1
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:33,951
The Judge from Hell

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,970
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,956
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE SITUATIONS

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,017
Defendant,
your final statement, please.

5
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,584
I know I won't see her again,

6
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,462
but I want to say
that I really loved Minjeong.

7
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,214
The defendant is hereby ordered

8
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,050
to pay a fine of three million won.

9
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,237
Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you!

10
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,310
<i>Please, let me go.</i>

11
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,647
I'll be back. Stay pretty.

12
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,818
She's dead.

13
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,781
EPISODE 2

14
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,367
Shall we go talk somewhere quiet?

15
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,620
What would we have to talk about?

16
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,709
Come on. It won't be long.

17
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,462
Okay.

18
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,940
What brings you here, Detective?

19
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,307
- You know why.
- I don't.

20
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,352
I told you clearly

21
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,729
to stay away from Cha Minjeong.

22
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,980
Actually...

23
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,649
Mom left when I was in high school.

24
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,359
Dad kicked me out when he remarried.

25
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,903
It's because I grew up without parents.

26
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,071
Shut up!

27
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,572
Not every orphan is like you.

28
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,408
So are you going to hit me?

29
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,118
That won't do you good.

30
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,373
Yeah. I'll beat you to a pulp

31
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:45,958
and resign.

32
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,547
It will really be
abuse of authority this time.

33
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,299
Let go.

34
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,772
Daon! Stop!

35
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,026
Aren't you Judge Kang?

36
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,445
- We meet again.
- Right.

37
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,755
- Do we arrest him without a warrant?
- He has to come on his own.

38
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,161
Will you come with us
on suspicion of stalking Ms. Cha?

39
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,997
You may refuse

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,459
and can leave during the transfer.
You also have the right to an attorney.

41
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,169
What'll it be? Clock's ticking.

42
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,630
I'll go.

43
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,902
- Let's go.
- Where?

44
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,037
Can you get rid of that?

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,873
I thought you didn't believe in God.

46
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,958
But you have a cross in your car?

47
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,502
You don't believe in God
but want to go to Heaven?

48
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,587
Is that it?

49
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,215
I don't want to go to Heaven.

50
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,842
You mean you can't.

51
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,678
People who raise their fists first
go to Hell.

52
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,349
And your car is weird like you.

53
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,726
Why were you at Moon Jeongjun's place?

54
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,063
To monitor him.

55
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,607
To make sure the person I released
is being good.

56
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,484
It's like a follow-up service.

57
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,030
- But where are we going?
- To do some follow-up service.

58
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,647
<i>Please, let me go.</i>

59
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,695
But can I kill
your parents instead?

60
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,948
I just asked you a question.

61
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,705
LOVE YOU TO DEATH

62
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,415
MINE FOREVER!

63
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,499
<i>How pretty.</i>

64
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,087
I'll be back. Stay pretty.

65
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,508
See the results of your ruling?

66
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,510
Are you sorry now?

67
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,595
Not at all.

68
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,765
Had you not released him with just a fine,

69
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,726
she wouldn't have been attacked.

70
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,230
What if I gave him one year?

71
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,232
This wouldn't have happened in a year?

72
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,735
At the very least,
the victim and her family

73
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,362
wouldn't have felt that
the law had abandoned them.

74
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,365
Your ruling was a secondary offense.

75
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,784
I merely made a ruling based on the law.

76
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,078
Stop pestering a blameless person

77
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,788
and resent the laws instead.

78
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,417
But it's you who ruled based on that law.

79
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,716
Countless people have lost their lives
from cases like this.

80
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,178
They appear in the news
and the public is outraged.

81
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,931
I'm talking about terrible crimes
and lenient punishments.

82
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,227
And everyone forgets about the dead.

83
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,229
And when someone dies again,

84
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,940
it starts all over again.

85
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,316
Is that my fault?

86
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:44,446
We'll apply for
an arrest warrant for Moon Jeongjun.

87
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,326
Is an arrest investigation necessary?

88
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,162
A few visits to the station
should suffice.

89
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,206
That's up to me, the detective, to decide.

90
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,003
He won't be released so easily this time.

91
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,173
Because not all judges will be like you.

92
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,905
<i>You broke into
Ms. Cha's place, right?</i>

93
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,025
No. Minjeong opened the door.

94
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,361
She asked you to come in?

95
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,445
Yes.

96
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,368
And you admit to assaulting Ms. Cha?

97
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,954
Do I have to answer this
when I'm here voluntarily?

98
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:37,875
Why did you bring this?

99
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:42,087
In case Minjeong needed something
to nail while I was gone.

100
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,716
After you left,
Minjeong hung herself in the living room.

101
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,678
Is she dead? No, right?

102
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,680
Didn't you want her dead?

103
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,390
What happened to Minjeong?

104
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,684
She's alive.

105
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,163
Please be understanding.

106
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,646
Excuse me.

107
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,939
I'm opening it. One, two...

108
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,360
Ms. Cha! Ms. Cha!

109
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,820
Ms. Cha, you can't do this!

110
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,530
Cut her down! Hurry!

111
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,990
Minjeong! Ah!

112
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:16,914
Oh, my God!

113
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,919
We told you
to come home with us.

114
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,505
Why didn't you listen to me?

115
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,672
Mom.

116
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,175
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,637
But can you please let me go?

118
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,351
I don't want to live anymore.

119
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,150
That's a relief.

120
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,735
I can't live without her.

121
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,696
She tried to die because of you.

122
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,115
She's a bit overdramatic.

123
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,536
And every couple fights.

124
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,788
Why must the state
intervene in our lovers' quarrel?

125
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,999
Fine. When you're in court,
repeat that nonsense.

126
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,086
That dating abuse
is just a lovers' quarrel.

127
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,341
It's been six hours now. Can I go?

128
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,429
- Park Donghun.
- Yes?

129
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,557
Get an arrest warrant.
Provisional measures, too.

130
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,641
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,643
Is an arrest investigation possible?

132
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,894
He almost killed her.

133
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,146
What kind of judge wouldn't approve it?

134
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,901
What the hell
is that bastard looking at?

135
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,444
I should rip his eyes out.

136
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,529
I'll get him.

137
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,614
Hey. Come here.

138
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:33,699
Damn it!

139
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,077
We should have
kept a closer eye on her place.

140
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,788
That was my misjudgment.

141
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:42,082
You did your best.

142
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,542
Eunseop's right.

143
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,252
He's the bad guy.

144
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,753
- Han Daon.
- Yes?

145
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,755
Don't let him out of your sight.

146
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,923
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,467
- Here.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,140
BABE, ARE YOU OKAY? I'M SO...

149
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,892
Come on. I'll take you home.

150
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,101
I'm fine.

151
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,772
I'm not.

152
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,982
Just come.

153
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,903
Darn it. He catches on quick.

154
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:16,742
Hey, Moon Jeongjun.

155
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,663
I'm going to sleep
in front of your house every night.

156
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,957
Don't even think about leaving.

157
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,672
<i>This number is...</i>

158
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,032
She's not home and won't pick up.
Where is she?

159
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,910
Jus... I mean, Judge Kang.

160
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,078
What happened?

161
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,581
You look terrible.
What happened last night?

162
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,065
Did you take care of it?

163
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,545
Does it look like I did? Does it?

164
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,382
Judge Kang.

165
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,717
Ah. That shower felt so good.

166
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,220
Here.

167
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,557
- Seriously?
- Right.

168
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,351
Here.

169
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,728
But what happened?

170
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,314
You didn't leave her to die, did you?

171
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,984
- She's alive.
- What?

172
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,821
Then...
It's over for this case, right?

173
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,365
Having a pulse doesn't mean she's alive.

174
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,244
Her mental state's all messed up,
and she has no will to live.

175
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,329
Breathing isn't living.

176
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:49,543
Still, a doctor has to determine her death
for her to be dead.

177
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,881
Are we defining life or death
by human standards?

178
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,215
Then why am I here?

179
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,217
Right. You're right.

180
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,805
Still, Moon Jeongjun
didn't kill her himself...

181
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,141
Mental murder is also murder.

182
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,517
Yes, you're right.

183
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,812
But Han Daon's the bigger problem.

184
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,732
I feel like he keeps getting in my way.

185
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,318
Just get rid of him, then.

186
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,404
Don't you know
I can only send those who've killed?

187
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,866
Justitia, go to the human world,

188
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,204
punish ten murderers who are unrepentant

189
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,206
and unforgiven,

190
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,751
take their lives, and send them to Hell.

191
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,170
You have one year.

192
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,716
Just leave Han Daon alone.

193
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,261
He is a pain in the butt,
but the way he challenges me

194
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:42,846
is kind of adorable.

195
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,307
Adorable? Justitia, don't tell me...

196
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,267
- No. So shut up.
- Yes.

197
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,899
Either way, this case is a fail, right?

198
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,402
If the arrest warrant is rejected,
maybe not.

199
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:01,823
Come on. You think
there's another terrible judge like you?

200
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,246
You really think there isn't?

201
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,170
Detective Kim,
the arrest warrant's been rejected.

202
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:16,713
What? Rejected?

203
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,382
- Yes.
- What's the reason?

204
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,510
He agreed to come in and cooperated.
He's not a flight risk.

205
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,597
Seriously?
What the hell is this crap?

206
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,475
If it were that judge's daughter,
this wouldn't happen.

207
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,436
Daon, go watch over
Ms. Cha and her family.

208
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,813
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,399
JUDGE KANG BITNA

210
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,331
Can you see me?

211
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,750
Yes, I can see you.

212
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,217
We checked the cameras
at Ms. Cha's apartment.

213
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:06,305
Insulation tape was stuck
on the outer lens, making it not visible.

214
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,058
I'll be in the area at night
for the time being.

215
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,394
If anyone comes by, don't let them in,

216
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,604
and give me a call.

217
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,357
I'll leave once I make sure
you've locked the door.

218
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,360
Okay, thank you.

219
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:21,695
Goodbye.

220
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:51,285
It's Detective Han Daon.

221
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,123
What is it, Minjeong?

222
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,500
I couldn't see then too.

223
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,795
And he said he was an officer.

224
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,214
It's him!

225
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,091
He's here to kill you guys!

226
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:07,551
It's all right.

227
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,180
Honey, call the detective now!

228
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,267
Why aren't you calling him?

229
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,938
If I do,

230
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,065
we'll be safe for today.

231
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:26,612
But even if he gets a prison sentence,
he'll be back out again.

232
00:16:27,196 --> 00:16:29,531
How long do you think
the police can protect us?

233
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:34,286
- Mom, untie me.
- No.

234
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,746
Dad, I'll go take care of it.

235
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,081
I'll go out.

236
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,625
Untie me!

237
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:43,086
Minjeong, look at me!

238
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,172
What did I say when I brought you home?

239
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,300
I promised I'd protect you
no matter what, didn't I?

240
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,972
No one can protect me, Dad.

241
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,191
Honey! Take her to the bedroom
and lock the door.

242
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:08,320
And don't come out
no matter what you hear.

243
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:11,657
Once it quiets down,
call the police. Okay?

244
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,204
- Hurry, go!
- No.

245
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,956
- Get inside.
- Dad!

246
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,791
- Come here.
- Dad!

247
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,380
- Let go!
- Minjeong, get in!

248
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,105
- Minjeong, please!
- No, Dad!

249
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,529
- Get in!
- Dad!

250
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,408
No!

251
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,326
Sir, calm down.

252
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,719
I'm sorry, Detective.

253
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,608
This is a smart watch.
You can each wear one.

254
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,818
When you press the SOS button...

255
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:31,195
It's my fault.

256
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,158
Mom and Dad almost died because of me.

257
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,118
It's not your fault.

258
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,792
But everyone says it's my fault.

259
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,295
That I have terrible taste in men.

260
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,088
That I dated the wrong guy

261
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,926
and I don't even know
how to end the relationship.

262
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,677
All this won't work.

263
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,930
It ends only when I'm dead.

264
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,561
Excuse me for a moment.

265
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,610
Yeah, what is it?

266
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,612
<i>Daon, Moon Jeongjun's dead.</i>

267
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,113
What?

268
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:28,001
The Judge from Hell

269
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,588
Justitia,
did something good happen?

270
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,382
You're glowing today.

271
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:38,387
Yes, the trial ended very well.

272
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,556
JUDGE'S OFFICE

273
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,785
- From the day before yesterday.
- What should I have for lunch?

274
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,362
12 HOURS AGO

275
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,956
<i>Jeongjun, it's me, Minjeong.</i>

276
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,293
<i>Meet me at 323-21 in Hwangcheon-dong
at midnight tonight.</i>

277
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,396
<i>You want to talk in person?</i>

278
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,173
It's too late.
I'm going to kill your parents first.

279
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:16,109
<i>If you keep this up,
I'm calling the police.</i>

280
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,676
The police? Go ahead.

281
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,345
What's a few months in prison?

282
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,222
<i>Don't be like that. Let's meet.</i>

283
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,974
<i>I'm the one you want anyways.</i>

284
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,058
Hey.

285
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,562
I know you're plotting with the police
to lure me out there.

286
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:29,771
<i>I'm not.</i>

287
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,148
Then get down here now.

288
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,443
<i>I can't. My parents are still up.
And the police are watching.</i>

289
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:37,237
<i>See you there at midnight.
We'll talk then.</i>

290
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,918
THE GREATCOAT
GIACOMO PUCCINI

291
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,871
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

292
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,106
DEMOLISH

293
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,953
<i>Minjeong, let's play</i>

294
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,200
Judge Kang?

295
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,370
What are you doing here?

296
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:54,124
What do you think?
I'm here to kill you.

297
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,418
What?

298
00:22:57,252 --> 00:23:00,005
Where are you hiding? Get out now.

299
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:05,859
Gosh. I'm so tired.

300
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,431
Seriously?

301
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,228
Can I go home now?

302
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:16,230
Yes.

303
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,190
Good work today.

304
00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:21,860
I had to work late...

305
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,553
because of you.

306
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,286
Your real trial starts now.

307
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:39,503
Do you admit that you, sinner
Moon Jeongjun, murdered Cha Minjeong

308
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,005
and yet are unrepentant and unforgiven?

309
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,634
Minjeong's not dead.

310
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,761
And Minjeong's already forgiven me.

311
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:50,889
I'll be the one to judge
if she's dead, if she's forgiven you,

312
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:54,059
and if you really are repentant.

313
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,644
Let me ask you again.

314
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,730
Do you admit to your crimes?

315
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,732
You gave me the fine.

316
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,278
It's all over now. Why are you doing this?

317
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:13,954
I told you.

318
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,081
This is your real trial.

319
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:18,597
I've never killed anyone.

320
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,587
I'm going to report you
for attempted murder.

321
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:57,956
What the hell?

322
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,918
Welcome to my world.

323
00:25:07,633 --> 00:25:11,345
You are about to be
on the receiving end of what you've done.

324
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:15,182
That's the rule in Hell. Understood?

325
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,143
Yes.

326
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,815
<i>Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Bitna.</i>

327
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,578
Wow, I'm full.

328
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:38,205
Already?

329
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:39,873
Have more, babe.

330
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:41,792
I'm full. I'm done.

331
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,296
- Are you ignoring me right now?
- What?

332
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,216
No, I'm not...

333
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:52,052
I said eat.

334
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:58,559
Eat.

335
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,477
Eat.

336
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:03,146
Eat. I said eat.

337
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:07,025
Are you crazy?

338
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,778
Are you crazy?

339
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,572
Why aren't you doing what I say?

340
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:17,744
Sorry, I won't do it again.

341
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:20,080
You know I can't live without you, right?

342
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,336
I'd rather die than break up with you.

343
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,671
I'll kill myself.

344
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,631
Hey, stop it!

345
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:31,258
Just put it down first!

346
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,349
Don't ever ask to break up again.

347
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,437
I can't live without you, okay?

348
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:47,232
Hmm?

349
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,155
Let's break up.

350
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:01,663
Break up?

351
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,169
So, is this...

352
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,379
a goodbye party?

353
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,299
What you did that day,

354
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,051
it's too creepy.

355
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,761
Let's end this.

356
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,975
I was trying to be nice until now!

357
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:25,395
I told you

358
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:28,607
not to ask to break up ever again.

359
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,546
For God's sake.

360
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,176
I kept this here just in case.

361
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,886
I'm finally using it.

362
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,556
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

363
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:01,765
Stop.

364
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,308
Stop?

365
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,602
This is only the beginning.

366
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,231
I think I'm going to die.

367
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:10,566
Please hurry up.

368
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:14,820
- Honey, open the door.
- Please come quick!

369
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,321
Open the door.

370
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:31,086
Honey, stay well until we meet again.

371
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:44,055
Hey...

372
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:46,185
You're home.

373
00:28:46,268 --> 00:28:49,229
I've been released.
Why didn't you tell me you moved?

374
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,481
How did you find me?

375
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:53,817
How did you even get in?

376
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,571
If you press that,
I'll end up back in prison.

377
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,074
It'll probably be a year this time.

378
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:02,201
But you know what?

379
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,245
Next time I come back out again...

380
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,207
I'm going to kill you.

381
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:12,002
Come in.

382
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:14,296
Hurry.

383
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:18,675
I'm making braised tofu
to celebrate my release. Oh, wait.

384
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,680
For betraying me and calling the police.

385
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:32,189
Oh, my.
You're hair's so long now, babe.

386
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:34,983
I learned how to cut hair inside.

387
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:36,920
I'll cut you after we eat.

388
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:39,655
I mean, your hair.

389
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:42,777
I won't...

390
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,910
call the police.

391
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:47,329
I'll give you whatever you want.
Money or anything.

392
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,331
So please, let's break up.

393
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,627
I told you not to ask me that.

394
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:58,173
All I want is you.

395
00:29:58,257 --> 00:30:00,592
But why do you keep asking to break up?

396
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:03,512
I told you not to ask me
to break up again.

397
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:06,348
Why do you keep ignoring me?

398
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,892
- Why won't you do what I say?
- Why?

399
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:12,396
Please just let me go. I'm begging you.

400
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,948
Fine. I'll let you go.

401
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:26,910
Go.

402
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,381
You'll never be free of me.

403
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:41,508
Until you die.

404
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:48,473
I love you, babe.

405
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,940
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

406
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,027
Babe, are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?

407
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,529
So why didn't you just listen to me?

408
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:04,656
Sorry, I made a mistake.

409
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,202
Babe, where are you going?

410
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:10,704
Oh, no.
It must have hurt so bad.

411
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,341
Babe, open the door.

412
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,343
The longer you take,
the worse it'll be for you.

413
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,136
Babe.

414
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:28,680
No.

415
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,098
Babe.

416
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:34,061
Open up before I get the bat again.

417
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:40,943
Babe.

418
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,030
Open the door now. Come on.

419
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,786
Do you really think you can escape me?

420
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:53,497
You're mine forever.

421
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:56,917
I love you to death.

422
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,552
Don't feel good?

423
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:11,807
I feel nauseous, too. But I had no choice.
This is part of the trial.

424
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,892
Those who do not admit their crimes,

425
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:17,020
shall feel the same pain
experienced by the victim and more

426
00:32:17,104 --> 00:32:19,606
before the trial can resume again.

427
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,692
Hell?

428
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:24,695
I'm here to take care of guys like you.

429
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:25,904
A demon from Hell.

430
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,448
So,

431
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:32,244
a crazy demon from Hell is here
to seek revenge for Minjeong?

432
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:36,707
Wrong. I don't do anything for humans.

433
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,002
I only take care of
disgusting murderers like you.

434
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:43,213
- Minjeong's still alive.
- No.

435
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:46,758
The night you trampled on her soul,
she was already dead.

436
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,059
That's ridiculous.

437
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:01,190
I told you before.

438
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:03,734
I'm the judge who decides
what's ridiculous or not.

439
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:06,278
Gosh, I'm being too nice today.

440
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,280
Shall I make a judgement now?

441
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,074
I was wrong, Your Honor.

442
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,492
Please forgive me this once.

443
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,953
I just don't get it.

444
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,207
Why do humans ask judges
to forgive them for crimes

445
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,250
they've inflicted on others?

446
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:23,837
Please, let me go.

447
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:25,589
Mmm...

448
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,136
Yeah, I'm still in trial.

449
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:33,430
Is the clean-up crew on standby?

450
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:35,307
They know the address?

451
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,240
Don't do something you'll regret.

452
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,742
You'll be the one
to regret, you bitch!

453
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,662
Die! Die.

454
00:33:56,828 --> 00:34:00,832
I'm going to kill you
and Minjeong and her parents. All of them.

455
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,793
So die!

456
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:05,587
Die!

457
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,761
Having fun?

458
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:33,031
- I couldn't control my strength.
- Sorry.

459
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:42,165
From now on,
I'm going to hit you the human way.

460
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,337
Let go!

461
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:52,027
How fun. Go for it again.

462
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,246
Die!

463
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,636
I hit you only
a fraction of how much you hit her.

464
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,180
But you're down already?

465
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:02,264
Get up.

466
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,349
Please, stop.

467
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,351
Cha Minjeong asked you the same thing.

468
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,145
"Please, stop."

469
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,274
Please forgive me this once.

470
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:16,278
Don't you pity me?

471
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,947
I was wrong, Your Honor.

472
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,075
You were?

473
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:24,328
Yes.

474
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,168
Do you admit
Cha Minjeong is dead because of you?

475
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:33,295
Yes.

476
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:36,423
If not for me,
she wouldn't have tried to kill herself.

477
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:40,552
But you know
she hasn't forgiven you, right?

478
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:44,014
Of course. I wouldn't forgive me either.

479
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,768
Are you really remorseful?

480
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:51,063
Yes, I really am.

481
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:52,648
Mmm.

482
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:56,026
And you admit you deserve

483
00:37:57,569 --> 00:37:58,570
to die?

484
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:03,075
Yes, I deserve to die.

485
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,581
Then die.

486
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,213
Go to Hell.

487
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,669
<i>Gehenna!</i>

488
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,207
Court is adjourned.

489
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:41,673
Isn't that just harassment?

490
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:46,303
You're here.

491
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,473
Hey.

492
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,683
Really? That's gross.

493
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:08,325
What's that on his forehead?

494
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:14,790
Looks like he was killed inside
and dragged out here.

495
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:16,375
You're right.

496
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:20,087
Why would they leave the body
where everyone can see it?

497
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:23,632
Maybe they wanted
to dump it somewhere far but gave up

498
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,634
or to display the brutality.

499
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:31,056
There are no bloodstains from here.

500
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,481
Way too clean, right?

501
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:41,483
Yes.

502
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:44,653
Doesn't seem like a murder scene.

503
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:48,156
Of course, it's clean.

504
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,242
They've been cleaning forever.

505
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,077
They're complete professionals.

506
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,412
Are they that good?

507
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:56,790
Of course. They're the go-to guys
in Seoul and Gyeonggi regions.

508
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:00,419
<i>Anyway, they've got
a good reputation in Hell.</i>

509
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,173
- But why haven't I heard of them?
- What?

510
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:07,259
Well, you don't really
care about underlings.

511
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:09,887
They're at the bottom
of the chain in Hell.

512
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,513
I'm an egalitarian, okay?

513
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:15,184
You have a tendency to overstate my evil.

514
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,060
I'm not overstating, it's a fact...

515
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,688
I mean...

516
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,148
Take it.

517
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:25,611
Justitia,

518
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,197
the police will be scratching their heads
thanks to these guys.

519
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,032
SERGEANT CLEANING

520
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:39,082
I'll clean the traces
of Justitia still left on the body.

521
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:47,883
This area is
completely destroyed, too.

522
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:00,354
<i>Oh, right.</i>

523
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:01,563
You know,

524
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:04,816
when I told them that you ordered the job,

525
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:07,653
they said they were completely honored.

526
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:10,072
And promised to be
extra meticulous.

527
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,078
Mmm. Let's go.

528
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,705
Get every crack and crevice today.

529
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:22,584
Justitia is a total pain.

530
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:24,086
If we make a mistake,

531
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:25,963
she'll have our heads.

532
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,799
I heard she's a complete nutjob.

533
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:33,095
But we can clean up the body for her.

534
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:36,223
Why did she ask us
to drag it out to the front door?

535
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,225
- Because she's a pain.
- Is she sick?

536
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,661
<i>I wanted to show them</i>

537
00:42:39,685 --> 00:42:41,353
what happens to bad guys.

538
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:45,274
But the police will see it, too.

539
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:48,402
Hmm. Yeah, I wanted them to.

540
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:52,239
Watching them muddle about,
unable to find any clues...

541
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:53,365
It's fun.

542
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,869
Darn it.

543
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,204
It's dangerous.

544
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:03,750
It doesn't all fit!

545
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:11,315
You'll break the car!

546
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:15,262
The National Forensic Service
sent Moon Jeongjun's autopsy report.

547
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:16,972
There are multiple fractures,

548
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:19,558
but the cause of death is heavy bleeding.

549
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,185
The stab to his abdomen.

550
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:23,729
Where was Moon Jeongjun last seen?

551
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:27,524
By the entrance
of Ms. Cha's apartment complex.

552
00:43:27,608 --> 00:43:30,277
He was caught on camera
talking on the phone with someone.

553
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,447
Three hours later, he got off a taxi
at Nobong intersection.

554
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,700
And then he was seen
walking towards Hwangcheon-dong.

555
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:39,828
I got his messaging history
and call logs from that time.

556
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:42,456
The last person he was in contact with

557
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:44,750
was using a burner phone.

558
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:48,462
Were there any people or cars
that approached there around that time?

559
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:51,798
That neighborhood is a redevelopment site,
so there are no cameras.

560
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:56,011
There's no one else
besides the villa residents.

561
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:57,095
WHO SPOKE WITH HIM LAST?

562
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,889
They were determined.

563
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:00,766
Request search dog assistance.

564
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:02,160
- Check all the empty homes.
- Yes.

565
00:44:02,184 --> 00:44:03,268
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

566
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:05,812
And did you look into the scar
left on Moon's forehead?

567
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,732
Yes. It's here.

568
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:12,653
I can't get used to that.

569
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:14,613
Flip the photo left and right.

570
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:23,497
It means "Hell" in ancient Greek.

571
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,999
In Latin,
there's a letter "H" in the middle.

572
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:28,585
- So it's read, "Gehenna."
- Gehenna? Wow.

573
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:33,215
Wow. Who on earth
kills someone and brands them

574
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:34,883
with the word "Hell"?

575
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,385
Gehenna...

576
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:38,428
Hell.

577
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:46,687
It's a lot, right?

578
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:50,399
I can see why judges die from overwork.

579
00:44:50,482 --> 00:44:53,527
To kill just one person,
I read all those case files all night.

580
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:55,863
But I still have nine left.

581
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,075
Justitia, I...

582
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:03,161
I thought about it.

583
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:08,542
We can select bad guys through trials
because this is a criminal court.

584
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,626
But...

585
00:45:10,919 --> 00:45:13,755
there's another place
teeming with bad guys as much as here.

586
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:15,632
The police station?

587
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:17,926
Become a policewoman?

588
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,846
No, you don't have to
become a police officer.

589
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:23,265
You can also do it
through a policeman you know.

590
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:25,976
That man Han Daon who you said was cute?

591
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:29,730
He won't tell me anything.
He doesn't like me.

592
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,148
Well, obviously.

593
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:33,025
He'd have to be crazy to like you.

594
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:34,735
Or...

595
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:40,115
Well...

596
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,242
So, what I'm saying is,

597
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:45,329
maybe you can try
getting on the detective's good side.

598
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:46,788
Forget it.

599
00:45:46,872 --> 00:45:47,956
I can find it myself.

600
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:53,629
- Yes?
- The chief judge asked for you.

601
00:45:53,712 --> 00:45:55,297
He's really mad. I wonder what it is.

602
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,799
What could I have done to make him...

603
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:01,845
Huh. She's so rude.

604
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:04,306
But what's up with that guy?

605
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:08,310
Find something.

606
00:46:11,522 --> 00:46:14,358
I, who you'd have to be crazy to like,

607
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:16,109
am leaving.

608
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:22,699
CHIEF JUDGE'S OFFICE

609
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:24,368
Judge Kang.

610
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,953
Moon Jeongjun.

611
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:29,623
How could you release him
with a mere fine?

612
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:30,707
At the very least

613
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:33,168
It should've been based on common sense.

614
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:36,839
Since when have judges
judged with their common sense?

615
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:37,923
What?

616
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,884
Are you going to take responsibility

617
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:43,637
if the defendant retaliates
against the victim?

618
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,557
What if I do?

619
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:53,438
Judge Kang, I know
it was a traumatic accident.

620
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:55,816
And that you're like this because of it.

621
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:57,818
But if you keep causing trouble like this,

622
00:46:57,901 --> 00:47:00,195
there's only so much
I can cover up for you.

623
00:47:00,279 --> 00:47:02,990
If you're a judge,
you should act like one.

624
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:04,575
And not only in trials...

625
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:06,743
Those loud outfits
and that disheveled hair.

626
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:08,579
And your makeup. Change it.

627
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:09,872
Understand what I'm saying?

628
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,292
But I'm dressed very elegantly.

629
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,669
Only respond with "Yes" or "No"!

630
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:17,087
No!

631
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:24,845
Gosh, my head.

632
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:27,472
Am I unwell?

633
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:31,268
If not for Assemblyman Jeong,

634
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,271
I'd banish her to the countryside.

635
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,355
ASSEMBLYMAN JEONG JAEGEOL

636
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,816
Oh, no. It's Assemblyman Jeong.

637
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:43,947
I heard you got an earful from the chief.

638
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:48,243
Is it just me,
or do you seem really happy about that?

639
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:50,287
Or course, I'm not happy.

640
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:53,749
You were in there for only ten minutes.
He let you off easy.

641
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:56,168
Who is this Assemblyman Jeong?

642
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,712
Is he my sponsor or something?

643
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:00,672
There he is.

644
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:04,051
<i>Volunteered serving
free meals at a homeless shelter.</i>

645
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:08,138
<i>To help them rejoin society,
Assemblyman Jeong...</i>

646
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:09,890
I don't know who that is.

647
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:13,060
Seriously? You don't remember
Assemblyman Jeong?

648
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:16,104
You can forget your parents,
but you should remember him.

649
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:19,024
You don't remember
breaking off the engagement?

650
00:48:20,067 --> 00:48:21,068
Oh, my.

651
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:25,239
I broke off the engagement
with this Assemblyman Jeong?

652
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,575
Not with him. With his son.

653
00:48:28,659 --> 00:48:29,910
His oldest son, I think.

654
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:31,370
Of course he was the oldest son.

655
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:32,913
His second son is a scumbag.

656
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:37,209
I guess I've been
too indifferent to myself.

657
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:54,893
Seonho, you look good.

658
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:56,436
Yes, I probably do.

659
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,771
I'm off drugs now.

660
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,897
Seonho.

661
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:05,737
How is Judge Kang doing?

662
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:11,910
She's your ex-fiance. Why haven't you
checked in on her at all?

663
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:14,246
Well...

664
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:17,124
I'm sure he's busy with work.
He doesn't have time.

665
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:21,044
I hear you're really busy with
the redevelopment of Hwangcheon-dong.

666
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:23,964
I saw it on the news.

667
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:32,139
I heard Judge Kang lost her memories
because of the incident.

668
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,600
Apparently, she's lost
most of her memories.

669
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:37,311
She's a different person now.

670
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:42,107
Please watch over her.

671
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:43,901
Of course. I've been

672
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:48,322
watching over her closely
like a mother hen looking after her eggs.

673
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:54,578
You should make the time
to ask after her yourself.

674
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:56,496
I will.

675
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:03,045
NO TO REDEVELOPMENT
WITHOUT RESIDENT CONSENT!

676
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:04,688
Should I drive if you're tired?

677
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:09,051
I have too much left to pay
in installments to let you drive it.

678
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:10,552
Then step on it more.

679
00:50:10,636 --> 00:50:14,723
If you were going to drive this slow,
why buy a sports car?

680
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:16,892
You have to drive slow in alleys.
Don't you know?

681
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:20,187
But why is this neighborhood so dark?

682
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,607
I hope that's all it is.

683
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:26,485
There are no cameras here,
so it's a scary neighborhood.

684
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,820
That's how I was able to send one.

685
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,198
I know it's going to be redeveloped,

686
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:32,908
but it's too run-down.

687
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,911
If only someone hadn't spent
all her salary

688
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:39,331
and racked up credit card debt
to shop at high-end brands...

689
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:42,459
Keep talking, and I'll redevelop
that mouth of yours.

690
00:50:52,803 --> 00:50:56,473
Why do humans think
being a judge is so great?

691
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:59,017
They work overtime every day
and still get criticized.

692
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:02,020
You wouldn't if you judged properly.

693
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:06,984
<i>Thy mercy is even greater</i>

694
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,778
<i>Than life itself</i>

695
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:11,488
HWANGCHEON VILLA

696
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,532
Oh, my. <i>Shalom!</i>

697
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:14,825
Damn it.

698
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:20,789
<i>Shalom.</i>

699
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:22,749
<i>Shalo...</i>

700
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:27,462
Going to church again tonight?

701
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:30,215
No, I'm picking up the elderly
from this apartment.

702
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:32,217
Oh, right.

703
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:34,761
Today's the neighborhood meeting.

704
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,264
Yes, but I won't be there.

705
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:38,682
What?

706
00:51:39,892 --> 00:51:41,059
But there'll be snacks.

707
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:48,025
Do you think I'm the kind of person
you can win over with snacks?

708
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:49,109
Yes.

709
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:22,434
Start talking so we can go.

710
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:24,269
I have to go collect the recycling.

711
00:52:24,353 --> 00:52:26,522
Gosh, what's the hurry?

712
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:27,606
All right.

713
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:31,610
I called an urgent meeting today
because...

714
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:36,240
Here. You can write down
your names and sign here.

715
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:37,866
- Here.
- Let me see.

716
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:41,912
This is a petition
against the redevelopment.

717
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:44,498
We all talk a lot about redevelopment,

718
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:45,821
but that's not...

719
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:48,961
You should stay longer.

720
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:52,673
You'll drone on and tell us to believe
in Jesus so we can go to Heaven.

721
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:54,091
Why would I?

722
00:52:54,216 --> 00:52:55,968
Drone on?

723
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:59,596
You should take
the side dishes I made there.

724
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:02,641
Goodness.

725
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,560
You should all sign, too.

726
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:08,730
At first, my friends all signed yes
thinking it would be a good thing.

727
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:11,191
They left and lived elsewhere
for a few years.

728
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:14,027
And when they came in,
they asked for a lot of money.

729
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,737
Who is this redevelopment for?

730
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:18,657
We should really think about this.

731
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,451
And when they moved, things like sofas...

732
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,536
I'll defer for now.

733
00:53:24,746 --> 00:53:26,874
I can't just sign anything
and regret it later.

734
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:31,378
Half off your rent
and no more maintenance fees.

735
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:34,381
That won't be enough to convince her.

736
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,968
KANG BITNA

737
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:40,095
Good.

738
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:43,640
We're now all in the same boat.

739
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:44,909
- Goodbye, then.
- What?

740
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,143
Where are you going?

741
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:49,438
Let's pray before you leave. Okay?

742
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:53,692
Lord, there's a woman
in her 30s who's lost her way.

743
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:55,861
Please keep our unit 201

744
00:53:55,944 --> 00:53:58,280
as far away from Satan as possible.

745
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:00,616
And pave the road to Heaven...

746
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,285
I got a reply.

747
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:05,871
- Already?
- Yes.

748
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:07,706
Lord told me...

749
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,919
to go home and sleep.

750
00:54:12,544 --> 00:54:16,215
Come to church with me next week...

751
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:22,346
That was exhausting.

752
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:26,350
Why does the landlady
have to be a church deaconess?

753
00:54:27,643 --> 00:54:29,895
I have to kill
the remaining nine and go back.

754
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:37,444
Extract information using Detective Han?

755
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:39,363
With what? How?

756
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:43,033
Like that?

757
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:48,413
You're a genius.

758
00:54:55,295 --> 00:54:56,588
Minjeong.

759
00:54:58,215 --> 00:54:59,508
TOP-NOTCH NOBONG POLICE

760
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:01,218
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

761
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:02,803
I'm a lot better.

762
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:04,721
And I'll come back to my work.

763
00:55:05,305 --> 00:55:06,390
That's great.

764
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:08,392
It's all thanks to you.

765
00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:13,105
Actually...

766
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:17,651
Judge Kang Bitna came
to see me a few days ago.

767
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:19,611
Why?

768
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:20,946
Crying again?

769
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,702
What are you wishing for today?

770
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:29,872
And did what you wished for last time
come true?

771
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:31,373
What did you ask for?

772
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:33,750
To save them.

773
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:36,628
My death was inevitable.

774
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:39,131
So I asked Him to leave me to die

775
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:41,967
and save my innocent parents instead.

776
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:45,179
I told you.
He doesn't really grant wishes.

777
00:55:46,555 --> 00:55:48,223
And He didn't.

778
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:50,684
You and your parents are all alive.

779
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:53,729
You didn't hear
I almost died because of you?

780
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,731
Sounds like you want me to apologize.

781
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:58,066
Sorry, I'm not at all apologetic.

782
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,402
Why did you come to see me?

783
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:02,487
The joy you feel
because Moon Jeongjun is dead

784
00:56:02,571 --> 00:56:04,615
is only natural because you're human.

785
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:07,868
I came to tell you there's
no need to feel guilty about it.

786
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,248
But if you still feel bad,
confess everything to Him.

787
00:56:16,293 --> 00:56:19,004
He's stingy about granting wishes.

788
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:23,258
But I heard He's generous
to those who tell Him their sins honestly.

789
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:29,306
We won't be seeing each other again.

790
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:30,474
Be well.

791
00:56:43,195 --> 00:56:45,697
<i>I still resent her.</i>

792
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:49,952
But when she said
I didn't have to feel guilty,

793
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:54,498
it comforted me more than anything else.

794
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:56,166
<i>Actually, that day...</i>

795
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:59,169
<i>I was praying for repentance.</i>

796
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:01,338
Dear Lord.

797
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:05,342
I know it's terrible of me
to be glad about someone's death.

798
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:08,679
But I have been freed from the fear
that he'll come after me again

799
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:12,349
and the terror
that he might murder my family.

800
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:14,101
I'm completely free.

801
00:57:14,184 --> 00:57:17,229
I wanted to give everything up
and take my life.

802
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:22,067
But I want to live again now.

803
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:26,196
I'm a terrible person, right?

804
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,388
What the...

805
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:55,934
What are you doing? That was dangerous.

806
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:58,687
Nothing happened. Calm down.

807
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:02,232
What are you doing here?
How did you know where I was?

808
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:04,443
Why am I here?

809
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:07,571
You blocked my number
and ignored my calls, so I'm here to talk.

810
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:09,281
How did I know where you were?

811
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:11,992
A detective from the station told me.
He spoke in a dialect.

812
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:14,244
He just told you I was here?

813
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:17,831
I said I was your girlfriend
and that I wanted to surprise you.

814
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,918
He said, "Daon is finally dating someone!"

815
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:23,003
He shouted a lot.

816
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:24,838
He gave me this address right away.

817
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:26,882
Why would you lie like that?

818
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:30,219
If you don't like that I lied, let's date.

819
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:31,762
Then it won't be a lie.

820
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:34,306
I care more about personality.

821
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:36,558
Mmm. Then I'm your perfect gal.

822
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:39,811
Let's talk over
some grilled pork and soju.

823
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:41,438
I don't want to talk to you.

824
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:44,566
This isn't just any pork.
It's deep scored.

825
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,527
And domestic, not imported.

826
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:47,945
You can have it all.

827
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:49,947
Really? Then that leaves me no choice.

828
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:54,243
I'll share it with the other officers
at the station tomorrow.

829
00:58:54,326 --> 00:58:56,537
And I'll tell them all about just how much

830
00:58:56,954 --> 00:58:58,705
we love each other!

831
00:59:03,794 --> 00:59:04,795
Oh!

832
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:06,171
Gosh, it's heavy.

833
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:08,048
Thank you.

834
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:09,925
Ah.

835
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:14,096
Judges are buried in records,
unaware of what's happening on site.

836
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,974
But I realized watching you

837
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:21,353
that the discouragement you feel when
a hard-to-catch criminal gets off too easy

838
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:22,980
must be really great.

839
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:30,821
So I wanted to treat you to dinner.

840
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:42,624
It's not cooked yet.

841
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:44,376
Yes, it's rare.

842
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,963
- Give it.
- Sheesh.

843
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:53,260
I heard you went to see Cha Minjeong.

844
00:59:53,802 --> 00:59:57,055
She told you already?
She must have really bad-mouthed me.

845
00:59:57,848 --> 00:59:59,224
She said you comforted her.

846
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:00,684
I never did that.

847
01:00:03,478 --> 01:00:04,855
I'm more curious

848
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:07,482
about what you think of me.

849
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:12,779
At first, I was grateful.

850
01:00:12,863 --> 01:00:14,156
Then you were cool.

851
01:00:15,324 --> 01:00:16,658
After the trial...

852
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:18,869
I'm sure you despised me. I know.

853
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:21,038
Then what about now?

854
01:00:23,874 --> 01:00:24,875
I'm confused.

855
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:31,465
It's hard being
a violent crimes detective, isn't it?

856
01:00:31,548 --> 01:00:34,384
Nothing in this world is easy.

857
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:42,017
Are there any cases
you just can't break these days?

858
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,853
Like maybe there's a brutal killer?

859
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:48,649
Like someone who caused someone's death
even if they didn't really kill.

860
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:51,276
- Cases like that?
- A lot.

861
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,738
Oh...

862
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:57,783
And among those, are any still uncaught?

863
01:00:57,866 --> 01:00:58,867
Hmm...

864
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:01,703
- It's confidential.
- I won't tell anyone.

865
01:01:01,787 --> 01:01:04,248
I don't have friends to tell anyways.

866
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:06,583
Makes sense that you don't have friends.

867
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:08,126
Still, no.

868
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:12,047
Fine.

869
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:19,012
Let's drink for now.

870
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:43,912
So, if there's a murderer you still
haven't caught, tell me their name.

871
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:46,456
I don't need many. Just nine.
Or even just one.

872
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:49,126
I'm just curious, please?

873
01:01:49,668 --> 01:01:50,669
Hmm...

874
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:52,963
Fine. But...

875
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:55,674
you can't tell anyone.

876
01:01:56,967 --> 01:01:57,968
Understood.

877
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:00,387
What are their names?

878
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:02,598
Han Daon.

879
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,933
I already know your name.

880
01:02:05,017 --> 01:02:06,560
I need names of murderers.

881
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:08,478
I know. Han Daon.

882
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:15,319
How can a killer become a detective?
Fine, don't tell me. You're mean.

883
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:17,863
Why won't you believe me?

884
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:20,032
I've really killed before.

885
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:22,367
Three people, in fact.

886
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:28,665
Really?

887
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:31,293
Yes.

888
01:02:31,376 --> 01:02:33,504
I stabbed them with a knife.

889
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,714
And I can still smell the blood here.

890
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:40,385
It never goes away.

891
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:43,347
It might have even gotten more vivid.

892
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:46,350
How did you become
an officer after killing three people?

893
01:02:46,433 --> 01:02:47,559
Is that possible?

894
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:50,979
I was young then.

895
01:02:52,773 --> 01:02:56,193
Do you feel bad for the people you killed?

896
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:58,153
They're already dead.

897
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,198
What's the point of apologizing now?

898
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:05,744
That's just self-consolation
to ease the guilt.

899
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:09,498
Did their families forgive you?

900
01:03:10,332 --> 01:03:12,626
They said they never would.

901
01:03:15,712 --> 01:03:17,756
That they'd curse me forever.

902
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:23,929
They said they hoped
I'd go to Hell when I died.

903
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:27,558
So...

904
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,103
you're admitting to your crime.

905
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:34,815
Of course. Not just any crime.

906
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:37,234
It's deserving of death.

907
01:03:38,443 --> 01:03:39,945
Do you think

908
01:03:40,863 --> 01:03:42,656
I could meet with the families?

909
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:50,998
You're sitting next to one.

910
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:54,793
What?

911
01:03:57,629 --> 01:03:58,630
Where?

912
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,008
Detective.

913
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:03,177
Get up, okay?

914
01:05:02,528 --> 01:05:04,238
You're still here?

915
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:07,407
I wanted to know

916
01:05:07,491 --> 01:05:09,868
if what you said last night is true.

917
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:12,704
What did I say last night?

918
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,585
Can you keep it a secret?

919
01:05:21,463 --> 01:05:22,756
So it's true.

920
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,135
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.

921
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:28,971
Thank you.

922
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:34,017
Everyone says I'm not normal
because of the incident.

923
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:35,727
Despite knowing about that,

924
01:05:35,811 --> 01:05:39,022
you're the first human to look at me,
a demon, without judgement.

925
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:41,859
And you have convictions

926
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:45,863
not easily found in other humans.

927
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:47,573
The conviction

928
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:50,951
or tenacity
to do what you believe is right,

929
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,579
no matter the cost.

930
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:55,539
That's why I like you.

931
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:58,208
And also because you're cute.

932
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:01,169
Oh, I see.

933
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:04,256
Either way, thanks.

934
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:06,800
Sure.

935
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:10,512
- Your hand.
- What?

936
01:06:11,221 --> 01:06:12,681
I said I'd take you on a walk.

937
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:16,310
Do you need a treat first?

938
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:18,020
Uh...

939
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:22,774
Where do you want to walk?

940
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:31,742
To Hell.

941
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:49,444
The Judge from Hell

942
01:07:49,528 --> 01:07:51,738
<i>Gehenna.</i>

943
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:12,843
You, Justitia, will be punished
for the wrong judgement.

944
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:15,721
If you object to the punishment,
I will kill you.

945
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,056
Do we know each other?

946
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:20,684
Justitia?

947
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:24,396
Can you tell me what happened on this day?

948
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,025
Bring back my son!
Bring me my son back!

949
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:33,405
<i>My mother-in-law's demanding she
have the death benefit under Jiho's name.</i>

950
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:34,615
Dad!

951
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:37,201
No my Jiho. He's my son.

952
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:38,660
<i>Where's the boy?</i>

953
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:41,205
He's at an orphanage
because they said I can't raise him.

954
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:42,581
She abandoned him?

955
01:08:43,415 --> 01:08:44,750
Jiho, are you home?

956
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:47,127
He's dead.

957
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:50,589
And bad adults must be punished.

958
01:09:06,063 --> 01:09:08,065
