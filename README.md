# raku-study
Exploratory programming using the Raku language

A place to share some code and meeting notes for the SF Perl Raku Study Group.

Upcoming meetings:

* Sunday, Apr 13, 2025
  *   https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89366078473?pwd=Iu8rQKIeZ3vRlhDZbaalmXAW8EJRkq.1

* Sunday, May 11, 2025


We start at 1 pm Pacific time, and typically finish by 5pm.
And the super secret code you need is "4RakuRoll".

An informal meeting: drop by when you can, show us what you've got,
ask and answer questions, or just listen and lurk.

Perl and programming in general are fair game, along with Raku, 

Regular meeting annoucements go to the SF Perl mailing list:
