# raku-study
Exploratory programming using the Raku language
 
A place to share some code and meeting notes for the SF Perl Raku Study Group.

Upcoming meetings:


*  Sunday December 21, 2025
    *  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82283798015?pwd=HVSTrTGNfyiAwUAoKApEbai2YesA9W.1

*  Sunday January  4, 2025

*  Sunday January  18, 2025
    *  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85190626109?pwd=T6fMkbuqpWBDEQEdnnxWhuxlEcnyyh.1

We start at 1 pm Pacific time, and typically finish by 5pm.
And the super secret code you need is "4RakuRoll".

An informal meeting: drop by when you can, show us what you've got,
ask and answer questions, or just listen and lurk.

Perl and programming in general are fair game, along with Raku,
