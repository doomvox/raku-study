# raku-study
Exploratory programming using the Raku language

A place to share some code and meeting notes for the SF Perl Raku Study Group.

Upcoming meetings:

After a three week gap (to skip the Fourth of July weekend):
*  Sunday July 13, 2025
    *  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89072676129?pwd=PXIZbISZ8u36nCaAz7t4NFuxSAKurE.1

*  Sunday July 27, 2025 
*  Sunday August 10, 2025 
*  Sunday August 24, 2025 
*  Sunday September  7, 2025 

We start at 1 pm Pacific time, and typically finish by 5pm.
And the super secret code you need is "4RakuRoll".

An informal meeting: drop by when you can, show us what you've got,
ask and answer questions, or just listen and lurk.

Perl and programming in general are fair game, along with Raku, 

Regular meeting annoucements go to the SF Perl mailing list:
