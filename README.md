# raku-study
Exploratory programming using the Raku language

A place to share some code and meeting notes for the SF Perl Raku Study Group.

The upcoming meeting:

* Sunday, Jan 26, 2025

We start at 1 pm Pacific time, and typically finish by 5pm.


An informal meeting: drop by when you can, show us what you've got,
ask and answer questions, or just listen and lurk.

Perl and programming in general are fair game, along with Raku,
