# raku-study
Exploratory programming using the Raku language

A place to share some code and meeting notes for the SF Perl Raku Study Group.

The upcoming meeting schedule:

* Sunday, Nov 10, 2024
* Sunday, Nov 24, 2024 
* Sunday, Dec 22, 2024
* Sunday, Jan 5, 2025
* Sunday, Jan 19, 2025

We start at 1 pm Pacific time, and typically finish by 5pm.


An informal meeting: drop by when you can, show us what you've got,
ask and answer questions, or just listen and lurk.

Perl and programming in general are fair game, along with Raku,
