# raku-study
Exploratory programming using the Raku language

A place to share some code and meeting notes for the SF Perl Raku Study Group.

Upcoming meetings:

*  Sunday August 24, 2025 
    *  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/87595273685?pwd=u7ycnGjflVd8oiH1hmZwlhkUefbhDA.1

*  Sunday September  7, 2025 
    *  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82386926377?pwd=mktWTX0qLCmZcxpGQK024hTo6rwZcv.1

We start at 1 pm Pacific time, and typically finish by 5pm.
And the super secret code you need is "4RakuRoll".

An informal meeting: drop by when you can, show us what you've got,
ask and answer questions, or just listen and lurk.

Perl and programming in general are fair game, along with Raku,
