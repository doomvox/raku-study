# raku-study
Exploratory programming using the Raku language
 
A place to share some code and meeting notes for the SF Perl Raku Study Group.

Upcoming meetings:

*  Sunday November 2, 2025 (CANCELED)

*  Sunday November 16, 2025
    *  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84152895736?pwd=kNH5nyvNSXdwJC3aIut6cBhXw2FTpR.1

(Sorry about the scheduling confusion lately: I'm traveling and my personal circumstances aren't co-operating with my plans: November 16th for sure.)

We start at 1 pm Pacific time, and typically finish by 5pm.
And the super secret code you need is "4RakuRoll".

An informal meeting: drop by when you can, show us what you've got,
ask and answer questions, or just listen and lurk.

Perl and programming in general are fair game, along with Raku,
