# raku-study
Exploratory programming using the Raku language

A place to share some code and meeting notes for the SF Perl Raku Study Group.

The upcoming meeting:

* Sunday, Mar 23, 2025

  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81750169963?pwd=SY3gIr63jZtsXVgW4PDXwbOdLavt1c.1
  And the super secret code you need is "4RakuRoll".

We start at 1 pm Pacific time, and typically finish by 5pm.

And the next meeting after that:

* Sunday, Apr  6, 2025
  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85760469780?pwd=blaqVorTdGvXoI1GaA2m2IaMtJAtpG.1

An informal meeting: drop by when you can, show us what you've got,
ask and answer questions, or just listen and lurk.

Perl and programming in general are fair game, along with Raku, 

Regular meeting annoucements go to the SF Perl mailing list:
