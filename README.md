# raku-study
Exploratory programming using the Raku language

A place to share some code and meeting notes for the SF Perl Raku Study Group.

Upcoming meetings:

*  Sunday October 5, 2025
    *  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84308531686?pwd=vveDUyyEOufPLWuLy6GjeoLSsK67se.1

    *  https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84152895736?pwd=kNH5nyvNSXdwJC3aIut6cBhXw2FTpR.1


We start at 1 pm Pacific time, and typically finish by 5pm.
And the super secret code you need is "4RakuRoll".

An informal meeting: drop by when you can, show us what you've got,
ask and answer questions, or just listen and lurk.

Perl and programming in general are fair game, along with Raku,
