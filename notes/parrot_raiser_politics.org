*** Parrot Raiser:
**** "A serious issue which bears on the group."
**** "How can supposedly rational people get so divorced from reality?"

***** From where I sit it's clearly the right that keeps going for violence
****** The left has mostly been sitting still and taking it
***** Standard MO on the right for many years now is
****** "always accuse the other side of what you're doing"
***** Admittedly, I haven't gotten past the first few sentences of this talk: my mind is wide shut
***** In the US we've got:
****** ICE acting like armed, masked thugs, raiding without obeying rules on warrants or identification
******* they grab people off the streets and toss them in grossly abusive dungeons
******* the South Korean engineers they locked up recently are only the most prominent of the victims
****** we have the National Guard being used to occupy Washington DC over objections of local government
****** we have the presidency openly intimidating major media, getting opposing voices "canceled"
******* the latest is you're not allowed to quote Charlie Kirk accurately
****** And I'm supposed to be upset about someone saying something mean at a conference?
