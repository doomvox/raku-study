** followup

*** TODO BUG in my setup:  my automatic save/push keeps overwriting changes pulled from github.
**** e.g. https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/commit/193650f11613b5e2e815d02d3444e86156acee01QQQQQq0qq`

*** look at match objects with mixed named and positionals: hashify, listify, what wins?
