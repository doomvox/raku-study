**** distinction .list and .List
***** practical difference: 
****** .list will give you something list-like (a Positional)
****** .List has to give you something of type .List
******* https://docs.raku.org/routine/list
******** "Subclasses of Any may choose to return any core type that does the Positional role from .list. Use .List to coerce specifically to List."
******** " @ as a prefix puts the initial scalar in a list context by calling .list and turning it into an Array."


****** earlier we were discussing case-sensitivity in URLs, here's an example close at hand

** topics
*** Rob: run, reading pipes
**** bruce hint:
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
die unless $run-me.IO.e;
#+END_SRC
***** https://docs.raku.org/type/IO/Path#File_test_operators

***** IO::Pipe has an os-error attribute for recent raku 
****** "Failed to spawn process nuttin: no such file or directory (error code -2)"

**** Rob has trouble getting things into raku ecosystem still
***** Test::Meta6
***** seems like things go through, and it doesn't, silent rejection, no diagnostics

*** marton reminds
**** https://raku.land/zef:dwarring/Pod::To::PDF/changes?v=0.1.9  
**** always escape your user input, kids

*** alan: docs site, using scripts 
**** bruce gray hint:
***** https://docs.raku.org/language/pod says:
    Rakudoc (aka Pod6)
    A markup language for documenting Raku code. Pod6 is now known as RakuDoc V1,
    and a new RakuDoc V2 specification exists.
********  https://raku.github.io/rakudoc
**** rakudoc V2 richard hainsworth talk
***** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPavXDyfnhU

**** alan sees breakage on upgrade with rakudo star
https://rakudo.org/star/source
***** TODO (there's a 2025.05 linux bundle I should really install)

*** bruce gray: spinoffs from upcoming talks

**** a problemette (challenge?) from "habere" (sp?):

Find the one nine digit number that uses all 9 digits 1-9 once each,
where the first two digits are multiples of two,
first three digits are a multiple of 3,
first four are multiples of 4, etc
until all nine are a multiple of 9.

e.g., 123,456,789 fails because:
the first four (1234) group isn’t a multiple of 4;
1,234,567 isn’t a multiple of 7;
and 12,345,678 isn’t a multiple of 8.

***** TODO extract some notes from here: 
****** /home/doom/End/Cave/RakuStudy/Notes/2025may25
***** points
******* needding roundrobin to handle uneven list sizes without dropping an item silently
******* >>%%<< a helpful idiom because it alerts about uneven list sizes
******* a case where XZ might've helped (but didn't)

***** marton discussion subjects: "still cooking"
****** keep an eye on raku-study github discussions, marton's on a roll there.

*** resouces

**** classic snark

*** speaking of hooks
**** i speculate we could use before/after hooks on grammars
**** a subject for next time perhaps
***** rob doesn't see the point
***** marton wonders how
****** i'm thinking subclass of grammar, override parse method...


** older topics from May 11

*** administrative
**** TODO bruce gray argues for an indendent "schedule" page that's linked to from here:
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/blob/main/README.md
**** email
***** tailorpaul@pm.em
***** doomvox@gmail.com
****** also working again 

*** remember zoom buglet: cursor not shared

** older topics from April 27

*** marton has some discussions going
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/20
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/18
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/16

** older topics from April 13th

*** double-colons have double meanings
https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5805

#+BEGIN_SRC raku
sub foo(::T $a, Positional[T] $b) {
    dd :$a:$b
}
foo 42, my Int @ = 666;
# :a(42)
# :b(Array[Int].new(666))
#+END_SRC 

**** That syntax, borrowed from C++ (??) gets the type of $a an assigns it to T
So then: $b has to be a Positional of the same type as $a.

**** Double-colon might *look* like a namespace separator, but here it isn't.
(In Perl 5, that'd be a shortcut to refer to the main package.)

**** Also: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5802


** older topics from April 6th

*** marton:
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/17
***** 
raku -e 'race for (^8).race(batch => 1, degree => 4) {sleep rand; .say}'
****** "race for" is at the very least not always faster then a bare "for"
****** "hyper for" is still another case
******* bruce finds bare "for" is pretty fast

*** deepmap, duckmap. flat
**** marton's discussion of duckmap was very clear: better than the docs
***** TODO docs bug: need a simpler example to introduce duckmap

**** habere points out we have: .flat(:hammer)
***** TODO docs bug: not documented in page for flat
***** https://docs.raku.org/routine/flat
***** Also: @a[**]
***** https://raku-advent.blog/2024/12/25/day-25-raku-2024-review/
***** released 2024.07, on use 6.e.PREVIEW;



** topics from Mar 9

*** rob: rakudo bug turned up in weekly challenge
**** .= operator not working as "explicit assignment"
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5803
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
## Example from the docs:
say ++$a.=abs;
say ++$a .= abs;  ## doesn't work
# Cannot modify an immutable Int (7)
#  in block <unit> at <unknown file> line 1

say ++$a.=abs;    ## this *does* work
# 8

## Marton's example
# -1.succ
# -2      ## the - is applied *after* the .succ increases value by 1

1.succ
# 2

-1 .succ  ## with the space, we start at -1 and step up 1 to 0
# 0
#+END_SRC raku

***** Marton looks up older reports:
****** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4996
****** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4863
****** https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3333

***** TODO doc bug (?): Traps of .= weirdness not adequate
****** https://docs.raku.org/language/traps
******* https://docs.raku.org/language/traps#Method_calls_do_not_chain
******* https://docs.raku.org/language/traps#Method_operator_calls_and_prefix_minus

**** added pointer to roast test
