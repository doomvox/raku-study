**** discussion group
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions 

** topics
*** Rob: run, reading pipes
**** bruce hint:
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
die unless $run-me.IO.e;
#+END_SRC
***** https://docs.raku.org/type/IO/Path#File_test_operators

***** IO::Pipe has an os-error attribute for recent raku 
****** "Failed to spawn process nuttin: no such file or directory (error code -2)"

**** Rob has trouble getting things into raku ecosystem still
***** Test::Meta6
***** seems like things go through, and it doesn't, silent rejection, no diagnostics

*** marton reminds
**** https://raku.land/zef:dwarring/Pod::To::PDF/changes?v=0.1.9  
**** always escape your user input, kids

*** alan: docs site, using scripts 
**** bruce gray hint:
***** https://docs.raku.org/language/pod says:
    Rakudoc (aka Pod6)
    A markup language for documenting Raku code. Pod6 is now known as RakuDoc V1,
    and a new RakuDoc V2 specification exists.
********  https://raku.github.io/rakudoc
**** rakudoc V2 richard hainsworth talk
***** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPavXDyfnhU

**** alan sees breakage on upgrade with rakudo star
https://rakudo.org/star/source
***** TODO (there's a 2025.05 linux bundle I should really install)

*** bruce gray: spinoffs from upcoming talks

**** a problemette (challenge?) from "habere" (sp?):

Find the one nine digit number that uses all 9 digits 1-9 once each,
where the first two digits are multiples of two,
first three digits are a multiple of 3,
first four are multiples of 4, etc
until all nine are a multiple of 9.

e.g., 123,456,789 fails because:
the first four (1234) group isn’t a multiple of 4;
1,234,567 isn’t a multiple of 7;
and 12,345,678 isn’t a multiple of 8.

***** TODO extract some notes from here: 
****** /home/doom/End/Cave/RakuStudy/Notes/2025may25

***** points: needding roundrobin to handle uneven list sizes without dropping an item silently
***** >>%%<< a helpful idiom because it alerts about uneven list sizes
***** a case where XZ might've helped (but didn't)

*** marton discussion subjects: "still cooking"
**** keep an eye on raku-study github discussions, marton's on a roll there.

** old topics
*** administrative
**** tim schafer informs the sfperl mailing list has been acting strange
***** not getting all posts, let him sign-up, didn't demand adminstrative approval, etc.
**** bruce gray argues for an indendent "schedule" page that's linked to from here:
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/blob/main/README.md
**** automate muliple announcements, e.g. to mailing lists?
**** TODO still need to fix issues with sfperl-- need to consult the elder gods

*** remember zoom buglet: cursor not shared
*** rob ransbottom hit a problem with mi6 installs breaking because someone casually "modernized" code
**** my take: you need to respect backwards compatibility, particularly with system tools 
***** maybe: avoid unconsciously assuming everyone is an expert
****** 6.d is still normal.  Can't go to 6.e or use a .early feature, etc.

**** rob's exposition: 
***** "early" features get released
***** turned up a prob when cleaning up old raku installations... 
****** can't install mi6, has to force tests
***** using a 6.e item when targeting 6.d
****** zef install App::Mi6
***** broken for 4 months, no one noticed earlier
****** someone fixed something, "modernized" something else while they were at it
***** installing zef is doable but weirdly linked to your version of raku (?)
***** idea: an "is-early" check, remove a test if needed, make it easily identifiable (?)
****** method traits can check what version you need if you want to use ".are"
***** my idea: need cultural change, don't revise system tools to just make it prettier ('modernize')
****** not really interested in opening a problem-solving issue ("it's in the docs already")
****** TODO maybe do it anyway?

*** marton reports something buggy about dependency management
**** sometimes need to do manual installs in just the right order

*** me: back to grammar school
**** developing a grammar to parse *.srt subtitles
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/Subtitles/messing_with_srts.raku
***** Rob Ransbottom suggests trying
****** Grammar::ErrorReporting
****** Grammar::Debugger
****** Grammar::Tracer
****** and there are more Grammar::modules on Raku.land

*** tim schafer: changing double spaces to dash, because meetup refuses to do indentation
**** various languages
***** https://www.mycompiler.io/view/D0fEE3RlGI4
***** https://www.mycompiler.io/view/0ZfXb6AzS1n
***** https://www.mycompiler.io/view/GIgDMTOCBYY

*** revisiting weekly challenge 313 task2 
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-313/
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-313/#TASK2

*** instrumenting a grammar
Code lifted by Rob Ransbottom from Moritz Lenz:
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
  method ws() {
      if self.pos > $*HIGHWATER {
          $*HIGHWATER = self.pos;
          $*LASTRULE = callframe(1).code.name;
      }  callsame;
  }   # how far did the  parse go
#+END_SRC



*** Bruce Gray hint, you can programmatically get at current state of your firefox, e.g:
**** /home/doom/.mozilla/firefox/vmjfk0oc.Dexter/sessionstore-backups/recovery.jsonlz4
**** lz4 compression (check cpan, etc).

*** Marton mentioned the Blin tool to install the whole ecosystem:
**** https://raku.land/github:Raku/Blin
**** https://github.com/Raku/Blin


*** the perl affair, my take (one more time)
**** strong initial successes: bioinformatics, WWW
**** this created an immediate panic in the computer science community
***** "perl is an ugly language!"
***** Larry Wall: weirdo outsider, not a serious member of the club
***** then there was effectively: a decade long smear campaign
****** pushed Python heavily despite non-existant library support
******* needed to re-write a lot of code, but programmers *love* that kind of busy work
***** yeah: perl5 -> perl6 business wasn't handled well, 
****** this created an opportunity for the smear campaign
**** where does this leave Raku?
***** plugging along in the side lines until it hits a Killer App
***** then everyone will imitate it (whether that makes a lot of sense or not)
***** for years whatever Microsoft did was The Right Thing
***** then for years whatever Google did was The Right Thing
****** there's very little about this that's *rational*
****** Raku's not conistent enough?  Raku's philosophy isn't quite right?  
******* these are sideshows: Not likely to be the Key Thing.
**** perl's community focus was
***** not uniform
***** often trying to address outside criticism
****** typically in cpan development, though

**** perl tiobe index: 19
***** https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/

** old topics, last meeting, April 13th

*** double-colons have double meanings
https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5805

#+BEGIN_SRC raku
sub foo(::T $a, Positional[T] $b) {
    dd :$a:$b
}
foo 42, my Int @ = 666;
# :a(42)
# :b(Array[Int].new(666))
#+END_SRC 

**** That syntax, borrowed from C++ (??) gets the type of $a an assigns it to T
So then: $b has to be a Positional of the same type as $a.

**** Double-colon might *look* like a namespace separator, but here it isn't.
(In Perl 5, that'd be a shortcut to refer to the main package.)

**** Also: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5802


** topics from last meeting, April 6th

*** jeff's grammars question
**** parsing tokens run together, not separated by whitespace
***** jeff:
#+BEGIN_SRC txt
Tokens run together: 

FOOBAR#BAR"STRINGFOO"

The following are tokens:

- FOO
- BAR#
- BAR
- "STRINGFOO"

#+END_SRC 
***** TODO bruce gray has a solution (see saved chat)
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
    grammar G {
        regex TOP  { [ <foo> | <bar_hash> | <bar_plain> | <a_string> ]+ } # using `regex` where we would usually use `rule`
        token foo       { 'FOO'           }
        token bar_hash  { 'BAR#'          }
        token bar_plain { 'BAR'           }
        token a_string  { '"' <-["]>* '"' }
    }
    my $s = 'FOOBAR#BAR"STRINGFOO"';
    my $p = G.parse($s)
        orelse die;
    say $p;
  # Output:
  #     ｢FOOBAR#BAR"STRINGFOO"｣
  #      foo => ｢FOO｣
  #      bar_hash => ｢BAR#｣
  #      bar_plain => ｢BAR｣
  #      a_string => ｢"STRINGFOO"｣
#+END_SRC 

*** marton:
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/17
***** 
raku -e 'race for (^8).race(batch => 1, degree => 4) {sleep rand; .say}'
****** "race for" is at the very least not always faster then a bare "for"
****** "hyper for" is still another case
******* bruce finds bare "for" is pretty fast


*** tim refers to odd string reversal challenge
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-313/
**** tim's solution in clojure (next meeting: april 13th)
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
```clj
(let [s "_c-!h_all-en!g_e"]
  (loop [chars (vec s) letters (filter alpha? chars) result ()]
    (if-let [ch (peek chars)]
      (if (alpha? ch)
        (recur (pop chars) (rest letters) (cons (first letters) result))
        (recur (pop chars) letters (cons ch result)))
      (str/join result))))
```
#+END_SRC 

**** bruce summarizes some raku solutions
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
# barroff
    my @characters = grep({ $_ ~~ m:i/ <[a..z]> / }, $str.comb);
    map({ $_ ~~ m:i/ <[a..z]> / ?? @characters.pop !! $_ }, $str.comb).join;
# feng-chang
    my @s = $s.comb;
    my @ndx = (^+@s).grep({ @s[$_] ~~ ('a'..'z')|('A'..'Z') });
    @s[@ndx] = @s[@ndx].reverse;
    put @s.join;
# jaldhar-h-vyas
    my @reversed = $str.comb.grep({ /<alpha>/ }).reverse;
    my $index = 0;
    ($str.subst(/<alpha>/, { @reversed[$index++] }, :g)).say;
# mark-anderson (similar to bruce's approach)
    my @s   = $str.comb;
    my @k   = @s.grep(/:i <[a..z]>/, :k);
    @s[@k] .= reverse;
    [~] @s
# wambash
    sprintf $str.trans( /<:alpha>/ => "%s"), $str.comb(/<:alpha>/).reverse
#+END_SRC 


*** deepmap, duckmap. flat
**** marton's discussion of duckmap was very clear: better than the docs
***** TODO docs bug: need a simpler example to introduce duckmap

**** habere points out we have: .flat(:hammer)
***** TODO docs bug: not documented in page for flat
***** https://docs.raku.org/routine/flat
***** Also: @a[**]

***** released 2024.07, on use 6.e.PREVIEW;



** topics from Mar 9

*** rob: rakudo bug turned up in weekly challenge
**** .= operator not working as "explicit assignment"
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5803
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
## Example from the docs:
say ++$a.=abs;
say ++$a .= abs;  ## doesn't work
# Cannot modify an immutable Int (7)
#  in block <unit> at <unknown file> line 1

say ++$a.=abs;    ## this *does* work
# 8

## Marton's example
# -1.succ
# -2      ## the - is applied *after* the .succ increases value by 1

1.succ
# 2

-1 .succ  ## with the space, we start at -1 and step up 1 to 0
# 0
#+END_SRC raku

***** Marton looks up older reports:
****** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4996
****** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4863
****** https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/3333

***** TODO doc bug (?): Traps of .= weirdness not adequate
