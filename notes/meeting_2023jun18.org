*** placeholder variables
**** note: finding "placeholder variables" via the doc index is difficult.
**** @^longname
***** the @ sigil works (I missed this somehow)
***** longer var names work (and I didn't remember that)
***** https://docs.raku.org/language/variables
****** still needs a few more code example
******* TODO add if/else example right after
******** "This can be especially significant with constructs such as with, for, and if that are often used without much consideration of the fact that they create blocks."
******* TODO add an array arg example, right after:
******** "Thus @^array, %^hash, and &^fun are all valid placeholder variables."

*** reduction operator has to handle different data types differently:

#+BEGIN_SRC raku

 my @a = 1, 3, 5;

# this:
	[+] @a;
# is the same as
	1 + 3 + 5;
# Or you might say:
       ((1 + 3) + 5);

# but for this:
	[<] @a;
# can't act like
       (( 1 < 3 ) < 5 )
# because this doesn't make sense
       (True < 5)

#+END_SRC
