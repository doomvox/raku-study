**** if you exepct promise code may hang, you can't time it out from the outside
**** bg case: wants to report precisely what will create a hang-up

*** TODO BUG in my setup:  my automatic save/push keeps overwriting changes pulled from github.
**** e.g. https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/commit/193650f11613b5e2e815d02d3444e86156acee01

*** weak auto generated docs:
https://new-raku.finanalyst.org/routine/resolve

**** A thought: use data from Search box and page views to programmatically estimate importance 

** followup

*** revise my auto-push-on-save feature, should merge not over-write.
