***** Has one of the clearer descriptions of Raku-style multi-dispatch
****** though the subject here is the Damian perl module Multi::Dispatch
***** @30min: multidispatch discussion begins 
***** @48:50: multidispatch call resolution
***** @52:00: ABCDEFGHI
****** central idea: call the 'most specific' option

| A | Arity            |                                                      |                                  |   |
| B | Beforehandedness | :before                                              |                                  |   |
| C | Constraint       | Types/Classes of args: try most derived first        |                                  |   |
| D | Destructuring    | multi xxx ( Int [$i, $j] ) {...}                     | Doesn't translate to Raku (?)    |   |
| E | Essentials       | More required (non-optional) args                    |                                  | + |
| F | Facultativity    | More additional optional arguments                   |                                  | - |
| G | Greed            | Slurpies are less specific, demote 'greedy' versions |                                  |   |
| H | Heredity         | For methods, most derived method wins                |                                  |   |
| I | Inception        | Order of definition                                  | problematic: even as tie-breaker |   |

****** my comments:
******* a tight explanation with clear examples, but it takes a half hour (of a 1.5 hr talk)
******** examples are in perl: steal them and rakuize them?
******* some principles are positive (reasons to promote), some read better as negative
******* Hard to write a clear summary of E and F, you need the code examples (not a good sign?)
******* Down at at 'H' we're suddently looking at the methods not the arguments
******** no objection, but might that confuse?  What if you expected H up around C?
******** verify it works like this in Raku
******* technical issue with "I":
******** when multis are defined in different modules, the order of use statments matters
********* example idea: handling negatives and positives where both sides want 0
******* my personal odyssey with "I"
******** it wasn't mentioned in the Raku docs until I added it
******** it's not in the original design documents
********* more like oral tradition: something Larry Wall said to Jonathan Worthington
******** it's not covered by the test suite (aka 'the spec')
********* I tried to add a test: the pull request has been ignored
******* not as simple as a cascade where the last is always invoked when all else fails
******** "Cannot resolve ... none of these signatures matches"
******** In some cases order-of-definition does not resolve ambiguities, in others it does
******* "Destructuring" 
******** specific to perl5, isn't it?
******** breaking down a conglomerate into named components automatically
