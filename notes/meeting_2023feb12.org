** topics
*** Issue 4207: "'say $obj.^methods' does not list all methods"
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4207
**** This has been working for a while with recent builds.  About time I closed it.
**** Used my "darkroast" repository to add a test file for this:
***** https://github.com/doomvox/darkroast/blob/main/S12-introspection/method_object_gists.t
***** bruce gray suggests looking into adding tests to roast

*** Issue 4435: "deepmap can mangle hash structures rather than just modify values"
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4435
**** Existing roast test for deepmap:
***** https://github.com/Raku/roast/blob/master/S32-list/deepmap.t
***** locally: /home/doom/End/Cave/Raku/Wall/roast/S32-list/deepmap.t
****** interesting bit ("gfldex++" is someone's handle)
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
# regression spotted by gfldex++
`is <a b c>.deepmap({ next if $_ eq "b"; $_ }), "a c", 'did next work';
is <a b c>.nodemap({ next if $_ eq "b"; $_ }), "a c", 'did next work';
#+END_SRC
****** Note: explicitly passes through "$_".
******* if this is understood to be a requirement, the docs should say so

**** Adding some darkroast tests (needs work):
***** https://github.com/doomvox/darkroast/blob/main/S32-list/deepmap_array_of_hashes.t
***** locally: /home/doom/End/Cave/Raku/Wall/darkroast/S32-list/deepmap_array_of_hashes.t
