***** group discussions at github
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions 

** topical

*** Grammar School
**** let's see actions
***** where do I .make?  Can I make whatever I want or just use the method name?
**** our story thus far:
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/GrammarSchool/orgmode_question_eol_dance.raku
***** "% \n" trick to allow optional final blank lines

*** Bruce
**** "steiner triple system" problem

*** Rob:

****  1. A possible coercion bug in Raku or Rakudo.

****  2. The Kokakosko sequence challenge (WC 356-1):

*****          A)  One detail on the Raku side of the Rosetta (Code) stone
            has me confused as to why it is not a self-referential
            definition bug.

*****         B)  That the same code might be bettel in expression and+or
            efficiency as an anonymous, or called, Callable inside
            of a Seq definition instead of as a Routine containing
            a Seq.





** Old topics from an era gone by

*** Anton Antonov ideas
**** copy editing jupyter notebooks
***** speeding up publication of raku blog posts
**** cyclic graphs maybe not needed in agentic AI
***** thinking in parallel
**** MCP raku package
***** made with LLMs
****** one tell: it's exhaustive, tries things every way
***** MCPs are for LLMs, as opposed to APIs
**** speed-up visualization of raku benchmarking

*** Rob:
**** questions  someone might just know.  
***** Red, htmx, websockets
****** looking for layout flexibility
***** bruce points out there's a lot of new CSS features
****** css grid

*** David Christensen:
**** question about "delayed functions"
***** e.g. succinct naming 
****** closure
****** lambda


** evne older topics
*** Márton Polgár
**** one for William Michels
**** A rosetta code topic: 9 billion names of god
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/26

*** Bruce Gray
**** syntactic quirk here
***** https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Statistics/Normal_distribution#Raku
***** reduction operators can act like function calls with arguments in parens
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
my $m = [+](@dataset) / $size;
#+END_SRC


*** Bruce Gray talk for the NAPR:
**** https://docs.raku.org/routine/classify
**** https://docs.raku.org/routine/classify-list
**** https://docs.raku.org/routine/categorize
**** https://docs.raku.org/routine/categorize-list
**** and the concepts in general, e.g. "group by" in sql
***** Márton Polgár: 
****** https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4293
******* "Apparently, when classify or classify-list has a tester that returns an Iterable, the individual elements of it will be considered a classification hierarchy, and hence create a nested Hash. "

*** lizmat, year in review
**** https://raku-advent.blog/2025/12/25/day-25-raku-2025-review/
***** some discussion of Hash::Ordered
****** Note: there's also a Hash::Sorted
***** Anton has a use case involving hashes ordered by value 
****** python dicts
****** https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2025/12/31/data-science-over-small-movie-dataset-part-2/
******* recommendation systems
******* wolfram: keysort

*** Rob sizes of arrays, martices
**** bruce's feeling is 2-d shaped arrays aren't working that well yet
***** but he hasn't checked in awhile
**** anton agrees
***** multi-d object arrays in raku seemd buggy
***** but sparse matrices are useful for data science
****** there's a raku package that's good, but too heavy 
******* doesn't like the way it changes operations, overwrites standard sigils
******* does have named rows and columns
****** dense matrices package
******* prefers named rows and columns
****** Math::Matrix package makes up for problems with hyper ops on 
****** Math::Matrix, Math::SparseMatrix

*** Richard Hainsworth on RakuDoc
**** https://coderlegion.com/9768/rakudoc-more-than-just-a-documentation-markup

*** Anton Antonov
**** I have two main show-&-tells:
***** WWW::Ollama — LLM run locally
***** Zeckendorf representations

*** tim schaefer 
**** mojo: cross-platform gpu code

** old topics (TODO trim)
*** rob: bug with list binding including a pair value 
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025dec21/binding_to_a_list_with_a_pair.raku

**** Bruce variation (different error message)
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
my @arr = "a", "b", "c", Pair.new('alpha','beta');
my ($m, $n, $o    ) := @arr;
##    Unexpected named argument 'alpha' passed
#+END_SRC

*** Anton topics:
***** Number theory in Raku
****** With pretty graphics
******* https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/antononcube/Published/Numerically-2026-is-unremarkable-yet-happy-Raku.nb
******** better resolution version of the graph graphic:
********* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-blog/9ad116dadc09437310a3f85c4bea3dfcb8090ff1/Articles/Diagrams/Numerically-2026-is-unremarkable-yet-happy/Happy-number-trails-upto-2026-graph.svg

***** Better highlighter by- and with LLMs
****** .. And CLI  for All.
***** Using Raku in Wolfram notebooks
***** An Emacs version with Babel-code
******* https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/how-to-use-Org-Babel-for-R.html
***** tree-sitter
****** no bindings for raku as of yet
****** https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers/queries/1-syntax.html
****** written to the c11 standard
******* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)
****** Q: how is it possible that Perl is supported? 
******* I speculate: there's *static* parsing for perl that's very good (but not expected to be perfect)
******* https://metacpan.org/pod/PPI
******* used by perlcritic, for example 

*** number theory: the old phedinkus? 
**** https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NicomachussTheorem.html
**** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachus

*** advent calendar piece by lizmat
**** https://raku-advent.blog/2025/12/17/day-17-an-issue-with-evaluation/#respond
**** Demo code
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025dec21/array_to_list.raku
**** ".splice" with no args returns entire list and zeroes it out
**** "|| BEGIN ()" 
***** hack to always return the *same* empty list rather than re-creating the object
****** one hopes this will be obsolete some day
**** ".List(:view)"
***** okay: converts to a list, but what's ":view"?
***** Bruce Gray looks up the source:
****** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/Array.rakumod#L468
****** note: "is implementation-detail" -- that's a standard attribute

*** pair constructor vs named arg and slurpy hash calls
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79849852/too-many-positionals-passed-error-with-slurpy-hash
**** Demo of problem
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025dec21/pair_constructor_vs_named_arg.raku

*** slurpy signatures and multis
**** TODO Q: can you use a "slurpy" in a sig to choose a multi to call?

*** side discussion of the jvm dropping the "Security Manager"
**** https://openjdk.org/jeps/486

** open projects:
*** links I expect to use again some day
***** duckmap examples are here:
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025jul13
***** Subtitle parsing
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/Subtitles

** follow-up
*** next time
**** before starting meeting, warm-up on "advanced" screen sharing
**** increase the font size in emacs
*** TODO 
**** new raku front page
***** leading code snippet has an very obscure idiom

*** TODO doc problems
**** https://docs.raku.org/routine/duckmap
**** Rat?  Not Numeric?
**** Why changed data with changed code?
**** Possibly, better examples?

*** TODO start a people file already
