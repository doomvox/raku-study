** Discussion continues: Unclear sharing of $/ causing race conditions #406
*** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/406
*** Bill fears that in 6.3 they're going to totally break current behavior of match objects ($/)

"I feel $/ should remain a user-accessible variable that gets set
upon a match. I'm not opposed to a special switch that sets $/,
but I think it's silly to demand that the user has to write `my $/
= ...` for every gosh-darn match test."

*** Cog Proof Assistant: https://coq.inria.fr/

*** Tim Schafer has issues with Unicode strings in various languages (Javascript, Python)
**** emoji (codepoints in the astral plane)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
s = "abc|⚫️\n⚪️|👨‍👩‍👧‍👧"
#+END_SRC
***** Bruce Gray shows Raku pretty much just works
#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
	raku -e 'my $s = "abc|⚫️\n⚪️|👨‍👩‍👧‍👧"; .say for $s.comb;'
#+END_SRC

**** unicode string given as hex (with codepoints in the surrogate pair region of BMP):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
	var s = "\ud835\udcaf\ud835\udcae\ud835\udca9";
#+END_SRC

***** the problem is U+d835 is in the surrogate code region, it's not really a character by itself

*** Willaim Michels: 	Current "Type System" discussion on github: 
**** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/426

*** Discussion of prospects for "AI" turning into actual AI
**** Q: are humans smart enough to understand human intelligence?
**** Q: is human consciouness based on physical processes that can be imitated by other mechanisms?
***** Mark A argues AI enthusiasts take it's inevitability on faith
****** (I agree, but conversely don't think it's impossibility is established either)

*** weekly challenge
**** the problems 
***** https://theweeklychallenge.org
**** the solutions
***** https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/

**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-267
***** last time, only got through 267 task 2
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-266
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-268
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-269
***** and this time, only got through 269, task 2

***** Rob's solution:
****** https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-269/0rir/raku/ch-2.raku

******* odd idiom
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
$_ := @a;
my @l .push: .shift;
## @l.push is *different* than this, this uses one last line 
## .shift is called on $_, but .push acts on @l 
#+END_SRC

******* dicussed raku's multidispatch
******** https://docs.raku.org/language/glossary#Multi-dispatch

******* TODO discuss whatever star

****** Mark A's solution 
******* https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-269/mark-anderson/raku/ch-2.raku


****** Bruce Gray's solution:

******* https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-269/bruce-gray/raku/ch-2.raku
******* https://github.com/Util/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/c269/challenge-269/bruce-gray/raku/ch-2.raku

******* discussed his test running boilerplate

******** pair notation
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
# A shorter version of this:

task2_basic => &task2_basic

# is this (no need to repeat the name):
:&task2_basic
#+END_SRC

********* note: I think the code could be simplifed via .name
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
with &task2_basic {
  say .name, $_( @args);
}
#+END_SRC
