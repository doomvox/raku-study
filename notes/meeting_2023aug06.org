*** rob adventures with raku's IUP module (competitor to gtk, perltk, etc.)
**** a portable graphical user interface library (from Brazil).

*** put vs say (Alan)
**** say does an implicit .gist
**** put does an implicit .Str
**** also: dd
***** say is more for casual use, it has cases where it intentionally mangles (e.g. abbreviating lists of over 100 elems).
***** put is better at showing you things as they "really are"
****** I wonder about issues with classes that redefine behavior of .Str

*** Martón docs issue, how to talk operators
**** https://github.com/Raku/doc/discussions/4337

**** is something even an operator, e.g. {}
