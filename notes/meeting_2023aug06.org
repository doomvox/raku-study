*** alan
**** put vs say
***** say does an implicit .gist
***** put does an implicit .Str
***** also: dd
****** say is more for casual use, it has cases where it intentionally mangles (e.g. abbreviating lists of over 100 elems).
****** put is better at showing you things as they "really are"
******* I wonder about issues with classes that redefine behavior of .Str

*** Martón docs issue, how to talk operators
**** https://github.com/Raku/doc/discussions/4337

**** is something even an operator, e.g. {}
