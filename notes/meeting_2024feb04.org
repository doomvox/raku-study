*** Undeclared routine "row"?  LTA

**** dropped comma: say "f: $f", " "  %row{$f}, "char count: ", %row{$f}.Str.chars;

Shortened for the meeting notes:
raku -e 'my %row = A => 1; say "abc ", %row<A>';
    abc 1
raku -e 'my %row = A => 1; say "abc " %row<A>'; 
    ===SORRY!=== Error while compiling -e
    Undeclared routine:
        row used at line 1. Did you mean 'HOW'?

** followup

*** TODO BUG in my setup:  my automatic save/push keeps overwriting changes pulled from github.
**** e.g. https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/commit/193650f11613b5e2e815d02d3444e86156acee01QQQQQq0qq`

*** look at match objects with mixed named and positionals: hashify, listify, what wins?
