***** utf-c8 eats anything (via Raku Weekly)

TIL about #utf8-c8 encoding in #rakulang: using it allows the code to
read non-UTF-8 files but still represent them as normal strings inside
the program.

The only gotcha is to remember to also use `enc => 'utf8-c8'` when
writing anything back to disk, if you need to do it because forgetting
it doesn't result in an error, unlike on input, but produces garbage
in the output, so you do need to be careful. But other than that this
is a pretty painless way of dealing with non-UTF-8 files.
