*** raku signature docs on "destructuring"
**** https://docs.raku.org/language/signatures#Destructuring_arguments
**** I'd had the impression they were a perl5 Multi::Dispatch thing

*** automatic FatRat upgrade behavior when you overflow Rat
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71764654/is-there-a-way-to-automatically-use-fatrats-in-raku
***** lizmat:
#+BEGIIN_SRC raku
# So to activate this globally to upgrade to FatRat, you'd do:
INIT $*RAT-OVERFLOW = FatRat;

# To activate this only for a lexical scope:
my $*RAT-OVERFLOW = FatRat;
#+END_SRC

**** raku docs
***** https://docs.raku.org/language/numerics
***** https://docs.raku.org/language/numerics#Rat
****** "The last Rational type-- FatRat-- keeps all of the precision you ask of it, storing the numerator and denominator as two Int objects. "
****** "A FatRat is more infectious than a Rat, so many math operations with a FatRat will produce another FatRat, preserving all of the available precision."
****** "Where a Rat degrades to a Num, math with a FatRat keeps chugging along:"

***** using sourcery in the raku repl:
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
use CoreHackers::Sourcery;
say sourcery Rat, 'new', \(1, 264)
say &infix:</>.sourcery(1, 264)         ## looking at the operator: /
#+END_SRC

**** weird Rat oddity: toofat Rats (that aren't FatRats)

***** With $n = 1 / $biggie, if $biggie exceeds 2^64, you get a Num
****** Though, if you use lizmat's trick, you'd get a FatRat
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
my $*RAT-OVERFLOW = FatRat;
#+END_SRC

***** But this, rather weirdly, just works giving you a Rat with a denominator that exceeds limit
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
$n = Rat.new( 1, $biggie );
#+END_SRC

***** Simple demo of this Rat oddity: 
****** A toofat Rat can become a FatRat but it can't become a Rat again
