***** Better highlighter by- and with LLMs
****** .. And CLI  for All.
***** Using Raku in Wolfram notebooks
***** An Emacs version with Babel-code
******* https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/how-to-use-Org-Babel-for-R.html
***** tree-sitter
****** no bindings for raku as of yet
****** https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers/queries/1-syntax.html
****** written to the c11 standard
******* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)
****** Q: how is it possible is it possible Perl is supported? 
******* I speculate: there's *static* parsing for perl that's very good (but not expected to be perfect)
******* https://metacpan.org/pod/PPI
******* used by perlcritic, for example 

*** number theory: the big fedinkus? 
**** https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NicomachussTheorem.html
**** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachus

*** pair constructor vs named arg and slurpy hash calls
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79849852/too-many-positionals-passed-error-with-slurpy-hash
**** Demo of problem
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025dec21/pair_constructor_vs_named_arg.raku

*** slurpy signatures and multis
**** Q: can you use a "slurpy" in a sig to choose a multi to call?
***** TODO

** olden topics from meetings gone by
*** the raku front page code example
**** topic variable considered harmful -- Damien (?)
***** https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/pull/272
***** my uniformed take
****** Damien has an obsession with bullet-proof encapsulation
****** perl programmers don't care
******* encapsulation can make debugging difficult
****** CS people are prone to belief in "one true way!", but those rarely hold up
****** Anton: a recovered monad believer
******* https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2025/11/16/monad-laws-in-raku/
 
*** Anton Antonov topics
I have four topics easy to hard:
1) Code highlighting: Raku vs LLMs
2) LLM-graphs for using parser-interpreter fallback structures
3) Recommender systems in Raku
4) Sparse matrix computation performance comparison between Raku and Python

*** Marton on Raku
**** latest: the headache operator
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/25

*** Anton Antonov: how to do a search index using LLM-style software (e.g. LLM::Graph)
**** The search process I have in mind is explained here: 
**** https://github.com/antononcube/EconomicsAI
**** htmx+Air+Red+Cro
***** Marton:
****** Red is the "big Raku ORM",
****** Cro is the "big Raku web Framework", 
****** Air is his own thing (not sure what it does) and 
****** htmx is some sort of common html templating system

**** zeromq 
***** ipc between emacs and other processes?
***** alternate to roll-your-own

**** uses vscodium 
***** opensourcified visual studio
***** anton uses his own JavaScript::D3 package 
****** dynamic, interactive graphs
****** better than Javascript::Google::Charts for this
****** Tim mentions Vega, Vega-light

*** raku and zef
**** Tried this, but NG:
zef install LLM::Graph --exclude="JSON::Fast"

**** This worked:
zef install LLM::Graph --exclude="JSON::Fast:ver<0.19+>"

**** Bad messaging from zef (the hint doesn't work at all):
===> Failed to find dependencies: JSON::Fast:ver<0.19+>
Failed to resolve some missing dependencies (use e.g. --exclude="JSON::Fast" to skip)

**** by the way, I have *a* version of JSON::Fast
zef install JSON::Fast
All candidates are currently installedg

**** mainstream application, though not often studied
***** raku docs, partition it in a meaninful way, query it
***** the vector database is smaller, can be shared
****** outside of zef, need to install
******* graphviz
******* h20
******** to what degree should you automate installation
****** tim: uv for python package management (maybe)
******* nix os on mac
******** e.g. used by a guy on raku dischord: rcmlz
******* jupyter install not easy
******** Raku Jupyter::Chatbook
******* docker
******** usually waste
********* time (Anton Antonov)
********* memory (Tim)
****** TODO write an org-mode grammar
******* follow Raku-Markdown-Grammar as example

***** rshiney, hark 
****** shiney translates to javascript from R
******* webapps in R
******* would be nice to have something like this for Raku
******** "homework"
******** cro-based ?

***** vector database, published and queried separately?

***** mit study: 95% of LLM stuff is prototype, not going to production
****** https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonsnyder/2025/08/26/mit-finds-95-of-genai-pilots-fail-because-companies-avoid-friction/
****** actual study might be better to read
******* https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai_report_2025.pdf

***** anton: llms energy intensive, 
****** but you can do a lot with grammar technology of raku, 
****** reduce usage of LLM to where needed

***** More from anton:
****** code packages
******* https://github.com/antononcube
****** videos
******* https://www.youtube.com/@AAA4prediction
****** scripts to simplify installation
******* https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-book/tree/main/scripts
****** Robust LLM pipelines (Mathematica, Python, Raku) 
******* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOsVTCQZq_s


*** tiobe september (rob)
**** perl is in the top 10
***** so maybe raku should keep an eye on that audience
**** tiobe works on stackexchange searches
***** so the older anti-llm crowd are over-repped (anton theory)

*** Using .& (William Michels) 
**** one-liner from dischord
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
raku -e 'say q:format/%s/(42)'

raku -e '.say for lines.grep({ /^<alpha>+$/ and .chars == 4 }).classify(*.lc.substr(0,1)).map(*.value.pick).map({ $_ xx (1..3).pick }).flat.pick(*);' unixdict.txt
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
.&some_routine

some_routine( 'function ja?' );
#+END_SRC

*** "Surfaces and Essences" by Douglas Hofstadter and Emmanuel Sander
**** Tim Schafer pick
**** using analogies to understand

*** grep URI line from file and trim trailing '#' comment
**** https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/799195/remove-new-lines-and-everything-after-comment-symbol-with-awk-or-sed
**** raku answer from jubilatious1 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 raku -ne 'print S/ \h+ \# <-[#]>+ $$ //;  file
#+END_SRC 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 raku -ne '.subst(/ \h+ \# <-[#]>+ $$ /).print;'  file
#+END_SRC 
***** note: the \h+ requires leading whitespace in front of the comment character
***** made the cut for the rakudo weekly

*** async in raku and python
**** https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/1n8hjrr/async_in_raku_vs_python/

*** anton subject:
**** Raku introspection nice for LLM implementations
**** OpenAI, LLM providers, release packages in python
***** python has *some* introspection

*** our friend the monad (tim and anton)
**** Marton: "Promises in Javascript are 'impure' monads" 
**** Anton: "glorified decorator pattern"
**** Raku "feed" operators similar (not consistent)
**** "in raku you can make monads that define your grammars"
**** TODO Everything about monads: 
***** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz5B4B0kVco

*** "is item" trait
**** https://raku-advent.blog/2024/12/25/day-25-raku-2024-review/
***** The is item trait can be used on @ and % sigilled parameters 
****** positional or associative is acceptable in dispatch if it is presented as an item
****** just a "tie-breaker": should always also a dispatch candidate that accepts when not itemized
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
multi sub foo(@a)         { say "array" }
multi sub foo(@a is item) { say "item"  }
foo  [1,2,3];  # array
foo $[1,2,3];  # item
#+END_SRC 
****** Q: what is this for, really?
******* things that are "itemized" don't iterate, e.g. $(1,2,3) vs (1,2,3)

*** knuth 'concrete mathematics"
**** bruce gray's favorite math book
**** https://archive.org/details/concrete-mathematics


*** some of my many open projects:
**** links I expect to use again some day
****** duckmap examples are here:
******* https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025jul13
****** Subtitle parsing
******* https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/Subtitles






** follow-up
