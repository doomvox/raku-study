** Rob Ransbottom requested Marton's banishment be rescinded soon
*** Marton doesn't argue for this, but suggests the case against him relies too much on hearsay
*** Richard Hainsworth speaks up in defense of the process
**** but is willing to listen to critism: 
***** Rob points out that the dozen or so stated grounds for being banned that aren't referenced in the decision.

** Discussion of the state of raku docs
*** Fixes made, and others on the way

** side issue from Rob about parsing postgres documentation
*** an oddity, it's not so simple to identify sections, e.g. examples and syntax
*** Rob uses his own "custom tags" (like a two-pass parse?)

** Marton revists weekly challege 270, task 2

*** tricker than it looks
**** not a good idea to presume the initial maxium value is the target for all

** issues with install SeqSplitter
*** weak job of changing name:
*** now ChainableSeq
*** Marton's theory: install SeqSplitter, skipping tess, then use ChainableSeq
*** needs patch to fix test, maybe a few other tweaks.

**** generate an index automatically?
**** write a monolithic summary page?
**** ship a concatenated single file version that's text searchable...
