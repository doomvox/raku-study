***** raku-study/bin/2023may21/range_bounds_method.raku

*** weekly challenge 
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-217
**** bruce gray on sorting

*** marton: language design
**** strong-typing / weak-typing debate, etc
**** types determine operations (pythonic approach)
**** alternately a "strong operators" approach, operator drives what happens, not the types
**** seems like "pythonic" is always workable, raku approach maybe not.

*** MAIN topic
**** documentation is pretty good
***** https://new-raku.finanalyst.org/routine/MAIN

**** jjmerelo 5-2, p.80: using MAIN for command-line args
***** relies on earlier data, example from ch3
***** elaborate ("real"?) example, but talks about everything but MAIN
***** "autodocumenting", but shows no doc strings

*** alludes to Supply/Tap for data difficult to chunk as "lines"
**** write/find code example
***** data: US mail addresses in simple text file


** csv hacks
**** jjmerelo's weak cookbook example: roll-your own csv parsing
***** improve 
****** line-at-a-time Text::CSV processing
****** pre-scan to confirm no complex elements
