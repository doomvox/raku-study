******* e.g. what does "self" refer to at any point?  Bruce argues it varies.

***** Bruce points to a perl guy who's spent time on time

***** Marton: "In theory, the real reason you aren't supposed to use NQP on your own is that it's absolutely not specced"


**** The mystery of: p6 bind attr invres

  invres

  in
   v       (value)
   res     (result)  (bruce agrees)

***** I theorize there were competing version, and once there was a competing routine which was called
****** p6bindattr

***** Bruce looked into the code history: yes that's what was going on

**** rakudo/docs/ops.markdown

***** ## p6bindattrinvres
p6bindattrinvres(Mu $obj, Mu $type, str $attr-name, Mu $value)

Bind $value into Attribute $attr-name of object $obj of type $type and return $obj.
This desugars to:

    {
        bindattr($obj, $type, $attr-name, $value);
        $obj;
    }


**** The Atari 800 docs definied error code to mean:  "Device NAK".
