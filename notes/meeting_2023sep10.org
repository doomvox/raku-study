*** TODO Bruce poses problem from rosetta code 

*** Marton issues rakudo repository

** announcements 
*** next meeting: in 2 weeks

** our story thus far (misc stuff from last time):

*** MAIN Num and pi
**** https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/15sk5oo/converting_arguments_to_num/
**** Marton:  Getopt::Long changes "enums" so they just work
**** Bruce: coercing to Numeric works with NaN but not pi
 raku -e 'say @*ARGS[0].Numeric'  NaN

**** my thought: design a new type that coerces the constants 


*** Anton Antonov working on org-mode execution of raku, pasting result under snippet
**** need: "zinc",  zero-mq  (message queuing)
https://zeromq.org

*** Bruce Gray brings up a not-a-bug:
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
.map(*.blah);
.map(&blah);
#+END_SRC

**** The & form works only if the routine takes just one argument.

*** start promise
**** if you exepct promise code may hang, you can't time it out from the outside
**** bg case: wants to report precisely what will create a hang-up

*** fez questions
**** tony o
**** https://github.com/tony-o/raku-fez/issues

*** weekly challenge

*** Bill M issue with two ranges/sequences

#+BEGIN_SRC raku

~ % raku
Welcome to Rakudo™ v2023.05.
Implementing the Raku® Programming Language v6.d.
Built on MoarVM version 2023.05.

To exit type 'exit' or '^D'
[0] > say grep({$_ == 1}, 0...5)
()
[0] > say 0...5
(0 1 2 3 4 5)
[0] > say 0...5,3...7
(0 1 2 3 4 7)
[0] > say 0...5;3...7
(0 1 2 3 4 5)
[0] > 0...5,3...7

(0..5 3..7)
[5] > put (0..5,3..7,)
0 1 2 3 4 5 3 4 5 6 7
#+END_SRC

**** trying to strip down the examples

#+BEGIN_SRC raku
## seems strange:
say 0...5,3...7;
# (0 1 2 3 4 7)

## is raku parsing it like this?
say (0)...(5,3)...(7);
# (0 1 2 3 4 7)

## so let's try that in pieces:
say (0)...(5,3);
# (0 1 2 3 4 5 3)

## and...
say (5,3)...(7);
# ()

## Here there be LTA afoot.
#+END_SRC

***** peculiar cases, but why no warnings/errors?

**** range and sequence are confusable: '..' vs '...'
