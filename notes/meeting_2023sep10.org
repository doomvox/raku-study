**** or at least, as okay as any website does these days

**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35007291/how-to-make-n-3-the-same-as-n-3-in-perl-6
***** zef feature --/thing, --thing
****** actually, that's standard with MAIN now

*** stackoverflow: simplifying code that acts on the same variable (using the topic right)
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76984798/avoid-repeating-the-same-variable-in-a-chain-of-conditions/76984855

*** docs for zef
**** https://github.com/ugexe/zef
**** we don't have a pointer to this in docs.raku.org (Will Coleda opened an issue)

*** the MAIN subject again (William Michaels)
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35007291/how-to-make-n-3-the-same-as-n-3-in-perl-6

*** $*PROGRAM and "use lib":
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77066880/when-is-use-lib-path-evaluated
***** Will Coleda says test docs use:
use lib $*PROGRAM.parent(2).child('lib');

*** TODO Next time: Ranges. Rob's continuing adventures

*** Rob: issues with getting a module available to fez
**** Will Coleda comments if zef says it's okay but it isn't, it's time to raise an issue

*** live running code on docs website
**** Bruce and Will discussed ways of using glot.io from docs.raku.org  

*** weekly challenge
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-233/
**** looking for similar words (one's with the same chars)

@input>>.comb>>.Set.Bag.values.map({ $^n * ($^n - 1) div 2 }).sum maybe?

*** TODO Next time: Bruce poses problem from rosetta code 

*** Marton issues rakudo repository
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5369
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4534
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4996

**** TODO Next time: https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2086 ?




*** doc side ToC change (https://github.com/Raku/doc-website/issues/215)
**** now live at docs-dev.raku.org
**** it deprecates the original issue - feedback wanted

*** Rakudo discussions with Bill on Github
**** Adding them (Márton) because it felt like we were running circles, in case we want to clear something up
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5239 (thunkiness of smartmatch - talked about the "happy path" last time)
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4534 (irreparable Pairs in Captures)
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5119 (resolving blocks in a list comprehension)
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5116 (comparing WhateverCode instances)
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/4996 (codegenning .= for subscripts as well)

*** start promise
**** if you exepct promise code may hang, you can't time it out from the outside
**** bg case: wants to report precisely what will create a hang-up






*** TODO BUG in my setup:  my automatic save/push keeps overwriting changes pulled from github.
**** e.g. https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/commit/193650f11613b5e2e815d02d3444e86156acee01

*** weak auto generated docs:
https://new-raku.finanalyst.org/routine/resolve

**** A thought: use data from Search box and page views to programmatically estimate importance 

** followup
*** intermittant mysterious issues with my keyboard/trackpad lash-up 
**** if you can't fix it, just replace 
*** revise my auto-push-on-save feature, should merge not over-write.
*** gather "Next time" TODOs above, enter in next meeting notes topics
*** review the following "leftovers"
*** find my old problem with $*PROGRAM and use lib
*** the MAIN subject (vs p5 getopt morass)

** leftovers from previous meeting 

*** MAIN Num and pi
**** https://www.reddit.com/r/rakulang/comments/15sk5oo/converting_arguments_to_num/
**** Marton:  Getopt::Long changes "enums" so they just work
**** Bruce: coercing to Numeric works with NaN but not pi
 raku -e 'say @*ARGS[0].Numeric'  NaN

**** my thought: design a new type that coerces the constants 

*** Anton Antonov working on org-mode execution of raku, pasting result under snippet
**** need: "zinc",  zero-mq  (message queuing)
https://zeromq.org

*** fez questions
**** tony o is the man
**** https://github.com/tony-o/raku-fez/issues


*** Bill M issue with two ranges/sequences

#+END_SRC

**** trying to strip down the examples

#+BEGIN_SRC raku
## seems strange:
say 0...5,3...7;
# (0 1 2 3 4 7)

## is raku parsing it like this?
say (0)...(5,3)...(7);
# (0 1 2 3 4 7)

## so let's try that in pieces:
say (0)...(5,3);
# (0 1 2 3 4 5 3)

## and...
say (5,3)...(7);
# ()

## Here there be LTA afoot.
#+END_SRC

***** peculiar cases, but why no warnings/errors?

**** range and sequence are confusable: '..' vs '...'
