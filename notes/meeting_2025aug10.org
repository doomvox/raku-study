*** Bruce Gray talk revisited
**** ambiguity of the phrase 'cross product' (in response to a pedantic question from audience)

***** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product
***** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product

**** see:
***** Bruce Gray talk on hyperoperators
******* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OMsWYLQLqU
******* slides
******** https://speakerdeck.com/util


*** older topics we didn't say much about
**** flatmap probably isn't deprecated
***** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/430
***** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/351

**** duckmap *has* changed in behavior: 
***** lizmat says this was inadvertant, but seems reluctant to change it back
****** (if one was a cranky cantankerous negative individual, one might complain about such things)
***** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/486
***** https://docs.raku.org/routine/duckmap

***** duckmap oddity was turned up last time:
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025jul13/duckmap.raku
******* interestingly: got a code example that works for 2023 raku but not 2025
******** it turns out this wasn't an intended change, what it should be is unsettled.



**** rsg discussion: "Distributions, modules, compunits revisited?"
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/23
***** Marton Polgar

**** antonov: raku not data scientist friendly
***** "sequence centered design"
***** but with strong package support, so maybe they don't need to know that stuff.
****** Q: "monadic pipeline" ?
***** raku llm tools a little behind 
****** llm issue: everyone has own protocol
****** <llama> models you can run locally
******* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model)
******* antonov uses llama file: LLaMA
******* https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/WWW::LLaMA
***** note to self
****** when you hear "LLM", think "document indexing"
****** there's nothing wrong with doc indexing, despite faddish terminology
****** anton describes it as converting text into vectors, and looking for nearest neighbors
****** there's a trick involving going after sub-sets of likely relevant info
******* this avoids spending weeks indexng everything available

**** William Michels, Raku for Scientific use:
***** combining ranges and sequences is a nightmare (?)

**** duck db
***** tool for csv files that don't fit in memory

**** discussion of raku vs R
***** R (and Mathematica) is lisp-like (antonov)
***** virtues of named vectors

**** complaint about raku's "rand"
***** can't supply a known seed to get reproducible results
***** complicates testing.
***** myself, i'm surprised there's no "seed" option
****** open a problem solving issue

**** anton did work on porting graphviz capability to various languages 

**** bill: hexbin in r
***** https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hexbin/index.html
***** https://r-graph-gallery.com/hexbin-map.html
***** https://r-graph-gallery.com/100-high-density-scatterplot-with-binning.html

*** would filtered inheritence make sense
**** when you want to inherit some of the material, but skip parts that don't make sense
**** a wonky idea of mine
***** use case: fix problem of trig methods available on Arrays

*** liskov substitution princple gets no respect
**** list behaves differently from array even though array is a list


** follow-up
*** log-in to stackexchange: think about giving William Michels some upvotes

*** TODO doc problems
**** https://docs.raku.org/routine/duckmap
**** Rat?  Not Numeric?
**** Why changed data with changed code?
**** Possibly, better examples?
