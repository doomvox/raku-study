***** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/430
***** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/351

**** duckmap *has* changed in behavior: 
***** lizmat says this was inadvertant, but seems reluctant to change it back
   (if one was a cranky cantankerous negative individual,
    one might complain about such things)
***** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/486
***** https://docs.raku.org/routine/duckmap

***** duckmap oddity was turned up last time:
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025jul13/duckmap.raku
******* interestingly: got a code example that works for 2023 raku but not 2025
******** it turns out this wasn't an intended change, what it should be is unsettled.
