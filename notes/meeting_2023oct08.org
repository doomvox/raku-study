**** 2017 blog RE Ruby Unicode support:  https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/ruby-s-unicode-support/
***** William Michels argues Raku's unicode handling is a key advantage here


Ruby 2.4 was the first release to support Unicode Case mappings (instead of just ASCII): https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2016/12/25/ruby-2-4-0-released/
Ruby "Issue" page, https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10085
Related Ruby issue: https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19317
