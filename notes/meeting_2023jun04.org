** topics

*** placeholder variables
**** note: finding "placeholder variables" via the doc index is difficult.
**** @^longname
***** the @ sigil works (I missed this somehow)
***** longer var names work (and I didn't remember that)
***** https://docs.raku.org/language/variables
****** still needs a few more code example
******* TODO add if/else example right after
******** "This can be especially significant with constructs such as with, for, and if that are often used without much consideration of the fact that they create blocks."
******* TODO add an array arg example, right after:
******** "Thus @^array, %^hash, and &^fun are all valid placeholder variables."

*** weekly challenge

*** "enumerated class how-to" by rob (rir)
**** That is, all members of the class are registered and indexed.
***** 'Indexed' 
****** all members of the class are in an Iterable/Iterator object.
***** 'Registered' 
******  C__D (and maybe U) of CRUD are provided
******* configuration would seem a simpler approach.
**** This is a follow-on-to challenge 219, #2, "Travel Expenditure".
