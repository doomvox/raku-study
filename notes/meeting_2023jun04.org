** topics
*** first topic: any more topics?

*** placeholder variables
**** note: finding "placeholder variables" via the doc index is difficult.
**** @^longname
***** the @ sigil works (I missed this somehow)
***** longer var names work (and I didn't remember that)
***** https://docs.raku.org/language/variables
****** still needs a few more code example
******* TODO add if/else example right after
******** "This can be especially significant with constructs such as with, for, and if that are often used without much consideration of the fact that they create blocks."
******* TODO add an array arg example, right after:
******** "Thus @^array, %^hash, and &^fun are all valid placeholder variables."

*** weekly challenge 
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-219/
**** https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-218/

*** "enumerated class how-to" by rob (rir)
**** That is, all members of the class are registered and indexed.
***** 'Indexed' 
****** all members of the class are in an Iterable/Iterator object.
***** 'Registered' 
******  C__D (and maybe U) of CRUD are provided
******* configuration would seem a simpler approach.
**** This is a follow-on-to challenge 219, #2, "Travel Expenditure".

*** MAIN topic (from last meeting)
**** documentation is pretty good
***** https://new-raku.finanalyst.org/routine/MAIN
**** the pod connection
***** https://new-raku.finanalyst.org/language/pod

**** jjmerelo 5-2, p.80: using MAIN for command-line args
***** relies on earlier data, example from ch3
***** elaborate ("real"?) example, but talks about everything but MAIN
***** "autodocumenting", but shows no doc strings

*** Supply/Tap
**** find code examples (I think jjmerelo "recipies" has one)
***** data: US mail addresses in simple text file

** csv hacks
**** jjmerelo 'recipe" has weak cookbook example: roll-your own csv parsing
***** improve 
****** line-at-a-time Text::CSV processing
****** pre-scan to confirm no complex elements

** announcements 
*** next meeting: June 18

*** perl & raku conference (formerly yapc) will be in toronto on july 11th-13th
**** Bruce Gray will be speaking
**** note: Alan lives in Toronto
**** deadline for hotel discount coming up soon in june
