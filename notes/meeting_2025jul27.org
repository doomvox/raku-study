** topics

*** Bruce Gray on hyperoperators
***** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OMsWYLQLqU
***** slides
****** https://speakerdeck.com/util

*** flatmap probably isn't deprecated
**** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/430
**** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/351

*** duckmap changed behavior: 
**** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/486
**** https://docs.raku.org/routine/duckmap

**** problem found last time: duckmap
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025jul13/duckmap.raku
****** interestingly: got a code example that works for 2023 raku but not 2025
******* it turns out this wasn't an intended change, what it should be is unsettled.

*** rsg discussion: "Distributions, modules, compunits revisited?"
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/23
**** Marton Polgar

*** antonov: raku not data scientist friendly
**** sequence centered design
**** but with strong package support, they don't need to know that stuff.
***** Q: "monadic pipeline" ?
**** raku llm tools a little behind 
***** llm issue: everyone has own protocol
***** <llama> models you can run locally
****** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model)
****** antonov uses llama file: LLaMA
****** https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/WWW::LLaMA
**** note to self
***** when you hear "llm", think "document indexing"
***** there's nothing wrong with doc indexing, despite faddish terminology

*** William Michels, Raku for Scientific use:
**** combining ranges and sequences is a nightmare (?)

*** duck db
**** tool for csv files that don't fit in memory

*** discussion of raku vs R
**** R (and Mathematica) is lisp-like (antonov)
**** virtues of named vectors

*** complaint about raku's "rand"
**** can't supply a known seed to get reproducible results
**** complicates testing.

*** farley
**** librasteve == steve rowe
**** jubilatious1 == william michels
**** util == bruce gray
**** 2colours == Marton Polgar  (with accented 'a' s)
**** doom == doomvox == tailorpaul == joseph brenner == me

*** antonov gets monadic on our pipelines
**** data shapers raku package 
***** steve
**** red 
***** 
**** see "raku for prediction" blog
**** R lang choices
***** shiney 
****** r studio interactive interface
***** hark

*** antonov recomends using llms for interconvesion between formats
**** rakudoc
**** markdown
**** jupyter
***** e.g. "converting jupyter notebooks to mathematica notebooks"

**** antonov goes fast:
***** "mindmap"?
***** "not just using pandoc"


** old topics (from last meeting -- TODO trim these)
*** videos for 2025 perl & raku conference just went up

*** would filtered inheritence make sense
**** when you want to inherit some of the material, but skip parts that don't make sense
**** a wonky idea of mine
***** use case: fix problem of trig methods available on Arrays

*** liskov substitution princple gets no respect
**** list behaves differently from array even though array is a list


** follow-up
*** log-in to stackexchange: think about giving William Michels some upvotes
