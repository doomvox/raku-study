***** 54 attendees

**** slide prep
***** bruce's advice on slide prep: start with big fonts
***** my advice: go with light bg if you want, but don't go all the way to FFFFFF

*** duckmap
**** https://docs.raku.org/routine/duckmap
**** /home/doom/End/Cave/RakuStudy/Wall/raku-study/bin/2025jul13/duckmap.raku
***** interestingly: got a code example that works for 2023 raku but not 2025
****** TODO was this intended behavior?

*** William Michels: Raku answers to shell questions
**** https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/797530/227738
**** https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/797471/227738
**** https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/797904/227738

*** rob's travails with pop <num_of_items> feature suggestion
**** xtra work
**** makes raku more complicated (?)
**** syntax
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
my @top_three = pop( @items, 3 );
#+END_SRC
***** Q: what order should they be
****** rob's idea: default to reverse order
****** I can see the argument to preserve the order
****** Suggestion: still another parameter to reverse from the default

*** would filtered inheritence make sense
**** when you want to inherit some of the material, but skip parts that don't make sense
**** a wonky idea of mine
***** use case: fix problem of trig methods available on Arrays

*** liskov substitution princple gets no respect
**** list behaves differently from array even though array is a list

*** weeklychallenge
