**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/23

**** raku llm tools a little behind 

** old topics (from last meeting -- TODO trim these)
*** videos for 2025 perl & raku conference just went up

**** https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/797904/227738

*** rob's travails with pop <num_of_items> feature suggestion
**** xtra work
**** makes raku more complicated (?)
**** syntax
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
my @top_three = pop( @items, 3 );
#+END_SRC
***** Q: what order should they be
****** rob's idea: default to reverse order
****** I can see the argument to preserve the order
****** Suggestion: still another parameter to reverse from the default

*** would filtered inheritence make sense
**** when you want to inherit some of the material, but skip parts that don't make sense
**** a wonky idea of mine
***** use case: fix problem of trig methods available on Arrays

*** liskov substitution princple gets no respect
**** list behaves differently from array even though array is a list

*** weeklychallenge
