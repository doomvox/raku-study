thanks for explaining - yeah raku can be a bit different, I get that it's not for everyone and that you have to be a bit of a contrarian to want to use it

fwiw its not an either/or though, raku has both

role composition: role R { method m { say 'ho' } } class C1 does R {}; C1.new.m; # 'ho'

class inheritance: class C1 { method m { say 'yo' } } class C2 is C1 {}; C2.new.m; # 'yo'

dang I did it again!

[raku has the vast majority features of the Java / C++ OO system but with much less heavyweight syntax]
