I bad idea whose time has come: notes-todo_raku
A FINO stack of bits or raku-ism I want to keep track of.

thanks for explaining - yeah raku can be a bit different, I get that it's not for everyone and that you have to be a bit of a contrarian to want to use it

fwiw its not an either/or though, raku has both

role composition: role R { method m { say 'ho' } } class C1 does R {}; C1.new.m; # 'ho'

class inheritance: class C1 { method m { say 'yo' } } class C2 is C1 {}; C2.new.m; # 'yo'

dang I did it again!

[raku has the vast majority features of the Java / C++ OO system but with much less heavyweight syntax]

Is there a convenient way to replicate R's concept of 'named vectors' in Raku, possibly using Mixins?

Recent questions on StackOverflow pertaining to Mixins in Raku have piqued my interest as to whether Mixins can be applied to replicate features present in other programming languages.

For example, in the R-programming language, elements of a vector can be given a name (i.e. an attribute), which is very convenient for data analysis. For an excellent example see: "How to Name the Values in Your Vectors in R" by Andrie de Vries and Joris Meys, who illustrate this feature using R's built-in islands dataset. Below is a more prosaic example (code run in the R-REPL):
