**** and the concepts in general, e.g. "group by" in sql
***** marton:
****** https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues/4293
******* "Apparently, when classify or classify-list has a tester that returns an Iterable, the individual elements of it will be considered a classification hierarchy, and hence create a nested Hash. "

*** lizmat, year in review
**** https://raku-advent.blog/2025/12/25/day-25-raku-2025-review/
***** some discussion of Hash::Ordered
****** But there's also a Hash::Sorted

****** python dicts
****** https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2025/12/31/data-science-over-small-movie-dataset-part-2/
******* recommendation systems
******* wolfram: keysort

*** Rob sizes of arrays, martices
**** bruce's feeling is 2-d shaped arrays aren't working that well yet
***** but he hasn't checked in awhile
**** anton agrees
***** multi-d object arrays in raku seemd buggy
***** but sparse matrices are useful for data science
****** there's a raku package that's good, but too heavy 
******* doesn't like the way it changes operations, overwrites standard sigils
******* does have named rows and columns
****** dense matrices package
******* prefers named rows and columns
****** Math::Matrix package makes up for problems with hyper ops on 
****** Math::Matrix, Math::SparseMatrix

*** Richard Hainsworth on RakuDoc
**** https://coderlegion.com/9768/rakudoc-more-than-just-a-documentation-markup


*** Anton Antonov

***** Zeckendorf representations

** old topics from Jan 4th

*** anton discusses some code highlighting work by librasteve
**** https://github.com/librasteve/Raku-Jupyter-Chatbook

*** anton: presents a graph generation puzzle-- question: how was this sorted?
**** He suggests there's a need for a Javascript::Vs ('vs' a visualization package in js)
***** Anton wrote this for 'd3':
****** https://raku.land/zef:antononcube/JavaScript::D3

*** long discussion of maze generation and solutions
**** dungeons and dragons
**** rule following 
***** right hand/left hand

**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025dec21/binding_to_a_list_with_a_pair.raku

**** Bruce variation (different error message)
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
my @arr = "a", "b", "c", Pair.new('alpha','beta');
my ($m, $n, $o    ) := @arr;
##    Unexpected named argument 'alpha' passed
#+END_SRC

***** Number theory in Raku
****** With pretty graphics
******* https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/antononcube/Published/Numerically-2026-is-unremarkable-yet-happy-Raku.nb

****** written to the c11 standard
******* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)
****** Q: how is it possible is it possible Perl is supported? 
******* I speculate: there's *static* parsing for perl that's very good (but not expected to be perfect)
******* https://metacpan.org/pod/PPI
******* used by perlcritic, for example 


*** number theory: the old phedinkus? 
**** https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NicomachussTheorem.html
**** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachus

*** advent calendar piece by lizmat
**** https://raku-advent.blog/2025/12/17/day-17-an-issue-with-evaluation/#respond
**** Demo code
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025dec21/array_to_list.raku
**** ".splice" with no args returns entire list and zeroes it out
**** "|| BEGIN ()" 
***** hack to always return the *same* empty list rather than re-creating the object
****** one hopes this will be obsolete some day
**** ".List(:view)"
***** okay: converts to a list, but what's ":view"?
***** Bruce Gray looks up the source:
****** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/Array.rakumod#L468
****** note: "is implementation-detail" -- that's a standard attribute

*** pair constructor vs named arg and slurpy hash calls
**** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79849852/too-many-positionals-passed-error-with-slurpy-hash
**** Demo of problem
