******* I speculate: there's *static* parsing for perl that's very good (but not expected to be perfect)
******* https://metacpan.org/pod/PPI
******* used by perlcritic, for example

**** https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NicomachussTheorem.html
**** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachus

***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2025dec21/array_to_list.raku
**** ".splice" with no args returns entire list and zeroes it out
**** "|| BEGIN ()" 
***** hack to always return the *same* empty list rather than re-creating the object
****** one hopes this will be obsolete some day
**** ".List(:view)"
***** okay: converts to a list, but what's ":view"?
***** Bruce Gray looks up the source:
****** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/blob/main/src/core.c/Array.rakumod#L468
