*** put vs say (Alan)
**** say does an implicit .gist
**** put does an implicit .Str
**** also: dd
***** say is more for casual use, it may intentionally mangle output (e.g. abbreviating lists of over 100 elems).
***** put is better at showing you things as they "really are"
****** I wonder about issues with classes that redefine behavior of .Str

*** Mart√≥n docs issue, how to talk operators
**** https://github.com/Raku/doc/discussions/4337
***** is something even an operator, e.g. {}
