***** group discussions at github
****** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions 
** topics
*** today's announcment quote
**** "An Empirical Investigation into Programming Language Syntax"
**** https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2534973
**** the abstract: 
***** explicitly a survey of "students"
***** uses the phrase "mistake rate"
****** what methodology?  maybe: given tests and graded them 
***** doesn't mention the sample size-- we can infer it was smal
***** when they say "syntax" it seems they mean keyword choices
***** six programming languages: 
****** Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum
****** "Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo)."
**** Raku would be in the competing set to C-like things such as Perl, right?
**** The paper
***** https://www.vidarholen.net/~vidar/An_Empirical_Investigation_into_Programming_Language_Syntax.pdf

*** grammar to parse org-mode files
**** (like to do more work on this first-- but might be up to the hand-wave level)

*** Anton Antonov
**** a topic chosen from a list of 5 or 8:
***** Practical Monadic Pipelines
****** https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2025/11/16/monad-laws-in-raku/
****** https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-blog/blob/main/Notebooks/Jupyter/Monadic-programming-examples.ipynb

**** if learning languages is good to stretch you're understanding, then learn different one's: perl, raku
***** maybe: need to expect to learn them deeply
***** e.g. python: not so stupid when used at length, more deceptively simplistic

*** William Michels at play on dischord
**** promises
**** andthen vs or else vs not andthen 
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/5917
**** https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/5919

**** docs:
***** https://docs.raku.org/routine/andthen
***** https://docs.raku.org/routine/notandthen
***** https://docs.raku.org/routine/orelse

**** Anton Antonov "Monadic programming examples"
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/blob/main/notes/meeting_2025dec07.org 
***** comparisons used of andthen and feed operator. 
****** See Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS)
******* https://tour.dlang.org/tour/en/gems/uniform-function-call-syntax-ufcs

**** Bill's examples of use of anthen
***** https://unix.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A227738+andthen

**** Bill: Brian Duggan post on the use of the ==> feed operator: 
***** https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.users/2025/09/msg11510.html

**** Marton
***** "I have spent the last week in the hell of async/io implementations and the infamous function coloring rant"

***** a claim perl's design was because of an in-built 'cultural conservatism'
******  https://www.beatworm.co.uk/blog/computers/perls-decline-was-cultural-not-technical
******* my take: the author sees what they want to see and cherry-picks evidence
******* the phrase "culturual conservatism" here means mainly "resistant to change"
******** the claim is also is lots of rude insiders who think they're experts
********* (yes that's why the linux kernel project has been such a flop)

**** Rob
***** double fat is the feed operator ==>
***** >>  
****** what does that do
****** array of arrays
****** /home/doom/End/Cave/RakuStudy/Wall/raku-study/bin/2025dec07/hyper_operations.raku
***** Bruce: Real use of `.hyper(:200batch)`:
****** https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sphenic_numbers#Raku

** discussion about time-- example of discussion customs not quite working right
*** https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/506
**** also 497
*** Rob has ideas on how to improve the customs
**** threshing statge to eliminate chaff
***** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaff
*** missing a "temporal" base class-- 
**** thoughts on refactoring by disconnecting classes from inheritence tree (?) 

** a few Rob questions
*** any opinions on Red
*** can you do multiple constants defined from a BEGIN
**** note the my style doesn't work with constant
***** my ($a, $b, $c);
**** bruce approach:
***** constant $FOO = BEGIN { ... };
**** bill: can you use state with a constant to expand it's scope?
***** bruce thinks not
**** but then constants are always defined at compile time like begin
**** maybe some tricks with the binding operator?
**** maybe an enum trick

** olden topics from meetings gone by
*** fron page code example
**** topic variable considered harmful -- Damien (?)
***** https://github.com/Raku/raku.org/pull/272
***** my uniformed take
****** Damien has an obsession with bullet-proof encapsulation
****** perl programmers don't care
******* encapsulation can make debugging difficult
****** CS people prone to "one true way!", but they never hold up
****** anton a recovered monad believer
******* https://rakuforprediction.wordpress.com/2025/11/16/monad-laws-in-raku/
 
*** Anton Antonov topics
I have four topics easy to hard:
1) Code highlighting: Raku vs LLMs
2) LLM-graphs for using parser-interpreter fallback structures
3) Recommender systems in Raku
4) Sparse matrix computation performance comparison between Raku and Python

*** Marton on Raku
**** latest: the headache operator
***** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/discussions/25



** old topics

*** Anton Antonov: how to do a search index using LLM-style software (e.g. LLM::Graph)
**** The search process I have in mind is explained here: 
**** https://github.com/antononcube/EconomicsAI
**** htmx+Air+Red+Cro
***** Marton:
****** Red is the "big Raku ORM",
****** Cro is the "big Raku web Framework", 
****** Air is his own thing (not sure what it does) and 
****** htmx is some sort of common html templating system

**** zeromq 
***** ipc between emacs and other processes?
***** alternate to roll-your-own

**** uses vscodium 
***** opensourcified visual studio
***** anton uses his own JavaScript::D3 package 
****** dynamic, interactive graphs
****** better than Javascript::Google::Charts for this
****** Tim mentions Vega, Vega-light

*** raku and zef
**** Tried this, but NG:
zef install LLM::Graph --exclude="JSON::Fast"

**** This worked:
zef install LLM::Graph --exclude="JSON::Fast:ver<0.19+>"

**** Bad messaging from zef (hint doesn't work at all):
===> Failed to find dependencies: JSON::Fast:ver<0.19+>
Failed to resolve some missing dependencies (use e.g. --exclude="JSON::Fast" to skip)

**** by the way, I have *a* version of JSON::Fast
zef install JSON::Fast
All candidates are currently installedg

**** mainstream application, though not often studied
***** raku docs, partition it in a meaninful way, query it
***** the vector database is smaller, can be shared
****** outside of zef, need to install
******* graphviz
******* h20
******** to what degree should you automate installation
****** tim: uv for python package management (maybe)
******* nix os on mac
******** e.g. used by a guy on raku dischord: rcmlz
******* jupyter install not easy
******** Raku Jupyter::Chatbook
******* docker
******** usually waste
********* time (Anton Antonov)
********* memory (Tim)
****** TODO write an org-mode grammar
******* follow Raku-Markdown-Grammar as example

***** rshiney, hark 
****** shiney translates to javascript from R
******* webapps in R
******* would be nice to have something like this for Raku
******** "homework"
******** cro-based ?

***** vector database, published and queried separately?

***** mit study: 95% of LLM stuff is prototype, not going to production
****** https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonsnyder/2025/08/26/mit-finds-95-of-genai-pilots-fail-because-companies-avoid-friction/
****** actual study might be better to read
******* https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai_report_2025.pdf

***** anton: llms energy intensive, 
****** but you can do a lot with grammar technology of raku, 
****** reduce usage of LLM to where needed

***** More from anton:
****** code packages
******* https://github.com/antononcube
****** videos
******* https://www.youtube.com/@AAA4prediction
****** scripts to simplify installation
******* https://github.com/antononcube/RakuForPrediction-book/tree/main/scripts
****** Robust LLM pipelines (Mathematica, Python, Raku) 
******* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOsVTCQZq_s


*** tiobe september (rob)
**** perl is in the top 10
***** so maybe raku should keep an eye on that audience
**** tiobe works on stackexchange searches
***** so the older anti-llm crowd are over-repped (anton theory)

*** TODO note to self:
**** look up the paper claiming people swearing by chatgpt advice are delusional

*** Bill brings up a one-liner from dischord
**** 

raku -e 'say q:format/%s/(42)'


raku -e '.say for lines.grep({ /^<alpha>+$/ and .chars == 4 }).classify(*.lc.substr(0,1)).map(*.value.pick).map({ $_ xx (1..3).pick }).flat.pick(*);' unixdict.txt


.&some_routine

some_routine( 'function ja?' );

**** "Sac Tech Social"
***** gathering in the sac area
***** sacramento slack
****** Sac-tech.com
****** also on meetup

******* https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/Subtitles


*** knuth 'concrete mathematics"
**** bruce gray's favorite math book
**** https://archive.org/details/concrete-mathematics

*** anton subject:
**** Raku introspection nice for LLM implementations
**** open AI, LLM providers, release packages in python
***** python has *some* introspection

*** our friend the monad (tim and anton)
**** Marton: "Promises in Javascript are 'impure' monads" 
**** Anton: "glorified decorator pattern"
**** Raku "feed" operators similar (not consistent)
**** "in raku you can make monads that define your grammars"
**** Everything about monads: 
***** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz5B4B0kVco

*** "is item" trait
**** https://raku-advent.blog/2024/12/25/day-25-raku-2024-review/
***** The is item trait can be used on @ and % sigilled parameters 
****** positional or associative is acceptable in dispatch if it is presented as an item
****** just a "tie-breaker": should always also a dispatch candidate that accepts when not itemized
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
multi sub foo(@a)         { say "array" }
multi sub foo(@a is item) { say "item"  }
foo  [1,2,3];  # array
foo $[1,2,3];  # item
#+END_SRC 
****** Q: what is this for, really?
******* things that are "itemized" don't iterate, e.g. $(1,2,3) vs (1,2,3)

** follow-up
*** next time
**** before starting meeting, warm-up on "advanced" screen sharing
**** increase the font size in emacs

*** TODO doc problems
**** https://docs.raku.org/routine/duckmap
**** Rat?  Not Numeric?
**** Why changed data with changed code?
**** Possibly, better examples?

*** TODO start a people file already
