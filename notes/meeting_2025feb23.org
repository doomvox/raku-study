****** use more foreshadowing 
******* maybe just if the journey is long
Before you get into something elaborate like the 'reduce' section, you
might jump ahead and give a simple example to let people know where
you're going:

"In Raku code, you might see something like this:

  $total = [+] @numbers;

That's just one way of doing a summation over all the numbers, but
you'll see constructs like that used in many different ways, those
square brackets work with *any* infix operator.

Now, let's back up and think about the general case of doing a reduce..."



****** on that slide with three code examples separated by vertical bars

I had trouble seeing the "stray dot" you were talking about,
which made the remarks about it mystifying.

****** zip example is well set up
three ordered arrays is the right number to use
to make the general case clear (and you can use
the word "triplet" and avoid "pair"). 

******* OPTIONAL side remarks about elisp stuff

Z and Zop obliquely reminds me of elisp's
   (mapconcat 'identity directory-levels "/")

A closer comparison, from dash.el:

  (-zip-with FN LIST1 LIST2)
  Zip the two lists LIST1 and LIST2 using a function FN.

(dash.el is a pretty funny nomenclature hack)
