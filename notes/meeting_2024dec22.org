**** (William Michels pick)
 
*** Bruce's issue with binding and `raku -ne`
**** https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/issues/4
**** (now the raku-study group has issues)
**** peculiarity bruce gray turned up last meeting:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
raku -n3 '{
   my (\k, \d, \f, \e) = .split("|");
   say join "|", k, d, $_, e for f.split(",");
}' file.txt

# Cannot resolve caller split(Any:U, Str:D); Routine does not have any
# candidates.  Is only the proto defined?

#+END_SRC 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 raku --target=ast -ne '
    my (\k, \d, \f, \e) = .split("|");
    say join "|", k, d, $_, e for f.split(",");
 ' file.txt
#+END_SRC 

***** M치rton Polg치r, 2colours:
****** the binding issue seems to be tied to destructuring in particular; 
my \k = .split: "|"; will work just fine

***** jubilatious1

****** the error I'm getting is "cannot assign to a read-only variable or value":

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat ~/key_test_4_bruce.txt
1	KEY2
2	VAL21
3	VAL22
4	VAL23
5	VAL24

# Now conventional sigil (works fine):

~$ raku -ne 'my ($k, $v) = .split: "\t"; say $k => $v;'  ~/key_test_4_bruce.txt
1 => KEY2
2 => VAL21
3 => VAL22
4 => VAL23
5 => VAL24

# Now with "sigil-less" variables:

raku -ne 'my (\k, \v) = .split: "\t"; say \k => \v;'  ~/key_test_4_bruce.txt
\("k" => \("KEY2"))
# Cannot assign to a readonly variable or a value
#   in block <unit> at -e line 1

#+END_SRC

*** case where a script vm can't perfectly port platform behavior: globbing at command-line

**** bruce exposition
#+BEGIN_SRC txt 
Unix shell globbing expand before the command gets it:

  slycmd *.mp3

Windows shells pass '*.mp3' string literally

perl has a pragma "autoglob" to mimic unix style.
