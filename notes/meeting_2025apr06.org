#+BEGIN_SRC raku
## Example from the docs:
say ++$a.=abs;
say ++$a .= abs;  ## doesn't work
# Cannot modify an immutable Int (7)
#  in block <unit> at <unknown file> line 1

say ++$a.=abs;    ## this *does* work
# 8

## Marton's example
# -1.succ
# -2      ## the - is applied *after* the .succ increases value by 1

1.succ
# 2

-1 .succ  ## with the space, we start at -1 and step up 1 to 0
# 0
#+END_SRC raku
