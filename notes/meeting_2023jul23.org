** topics
*** weekly challenge
**** this week:

*** rob
**** issue with raku "META6" file
***** "the META6 file is wrong"
***** maybe the blank source-url?

*** jubilatious1 (William Michels) at unix.stackexchange.com:
***** https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/227738/jubilatious1


*** perl and raku conference in toronto
**** anyone want to talk about it?

*** correction
**** Inframan is actually a chinese movie, not a japanese one


*** leonerd
**** PERL5 Data::Printer better than Data::Dumper
***** but not in Core (yet?)

*** interpolating code in a string
**** raku: "{}"
**** perl: "@{[]}"
## my $a = "some string  @{ [ call_name() ] } end of the string";
***** example: dbi_link
****** https://github.com/davidfetter/DBI-Link/blob/master/dbi_link.sql
******* postgres sql, with embedded perl (plperlu) with embedded sql with embedded perl
******* postgres raku?

*** from the bruce gray raku tutorial
***** starting with a question of mine
****** << 'a b' 2 3 >>
****** << <a b> 23 >> 
******* https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/tree/main/bin/2023jul23/angles_within_angles.raku
******* /home/doom/End/Cave/RakuStudy/Wall/raku-study/bin/2023jul23/angles_within_angles.raku
***** another question: hash keys with embedded spaces
****** /home/doom/End/Cave/RakuStudy/Wall/raku-study/bin/2023jul23/hash_keys_with_spaces.raku

***** why can't %h{} do quoting like %h<>?
****** my answer: braces imply code evaluation
****** side issue I wondered about:

***** (I think I tend to heckle Bruce Gray's talks)

*** bruce gray on sorting WHATEVER
**** available on youtube already: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTB-blT9UnY
**** perl uses stable sorts
***** repeatable behavior on a tie
***** good point: e.g. testing could be complicated otherwise
**** raku example is interesting (I didn't get that a list would work here)
#+BEGIN_SRC raku
@L .= soft: { -.IO.s, .IO.modified, $_ };
#+END_SRC

*** bruce gray command line 
**** uses seq a lot: nice and tight examples
**** my editorial: seq is suprisingly limited
***** to get leading zeros, need to use sprintf formatting features
***** doesn't work with characters, just numbers, why not "seq a z"
***** doesn't work with anything except decimal why not hex (though, hex via printf?)
****** mapgame script behavior


*** PERL5 Chad Granum presented three modules that sound great:
***** Importer
***** Atomic::Pipe
***** DBIx::QuickDB

*** Zaki Mughai intro to PDL and TensorFLow
**** impressively dense talks, probably best viewed again in video (text too small)
**** note: argues that PDL has advantages on R, "higher dimensionality"
**** often uses gnuplot for visualization

*** Q: greps that only check the first line (for example)?

*** alan point about purity of grep as filter
**** two faced behavior of single file and multi file case
**** second file of /dev/null to force grep to always behave like multifiles

**** editorial: I think there's something really irritating about grep's second argument
***** need to say "*" when you want all (maybe default should be all)
****** mostly an emacs thing?
***** relate
****** never wrote a "greps" for some reason




*** perl 5.38 (latest stable)
**** perl5 indirect object "new" disabled with 5.38
***** to get old behavior, now need to turn it on manually:

#+BEGIN_SRC cperl
use feature 'indirect';
#+END_SRC 

**** new oop features: class, field, method keywords (still experimental)
***** similar to cpan module Object::Pad
https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Pad

**** other features
***** https://www.i-programmer.info/news/222-perl/16431-perl-5380-released-an-appeal-to-new-blood.html

*** slurpy signatures (rob)
**** https://docs.raku.org/language/functions.html#Signatures
***** "functions that don't have reasonable behavior on lists of lists" ?
***** What diff *@ **@ +@?

*** :delete adverb on arrays (rob)

** announcements 
*** next meeting: August 6th
