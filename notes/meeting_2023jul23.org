***** (I think I tend to heckle Bruce Gray's talks)

*** bruce gray command line 
**** uses seq a lot: nice and tight examples
**** seq is suprisingly limited, even stupidly so
***** to get leading zeros, need to use sprintf formatting features
***** doesn't work with characters, just numbers, why not "seq a z"
***** doesn't work with anything except decimal why not hex (though, hex via printf?)
****** mapgame script behavior

*** PERL Chad Granum presented three modules, all sound great (check names)
***** Importer
***** Atomic::Burst 
***** DBIx::QuickDB

*** Zaki Mughai intro to PDL and TensorFLow
**** impressively dense talks, probably best viewed again in video (text too small)
**** note: argues that PDL has advantages on R, "higher dimensionality"
**** often uses gnuplot for visualization

*** yary
**** Hakim Bey
***** Peter Lambourn Wilson used this as a handle

***** it's a reference to something, but I don't/didn't know what

***** Mehmet Erdem song in Turkish titled "Hakim Bey"
****** english translation of lyrics makes it seem like he's addressing the judge, 
****** calls the judge "Hakim Bey", Bey is an honorific, "Hakim" can mean judge/ruler/god...

***** fun book
****** https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/hakim-bey-pirate-utopias

***** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lamborn_Wilson
"Wilson's occasional pen name of Hakim Bey is derived from il-Hakim,
the alchemist-king, with 'Bey' a further nod to Moorish Science."


*** Q: greps that only check the first line (for example)?

*** alan point about purity of grep as filter
**** two faced behavior of single file and multi file case
**** second file of /dev/null to force grep to always behave like multifiles

*** correction
**** Inframan is actually a chinese movie, not a japanese one

** from last meeting
*** perl 5.38 (latest stable)
**** perl5 indirect object new disabled with 5.38
***** to get old behavior, now need to turn it on manually:

#+BEGIN_SRC cperl
use feature 'indirect';
#+END_SRC 

**** new oop features: class, field, method keywords (still experimental)
***** similar to cpan module Object::Pad
https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Pad

**** other features
***** https://www.i-programmer.info/news/222-perl/16431-perl-5380-released-an-appeal-to-new-blood.html

*** slurpy signatures (rob)
**** https://docs.raku.org/language/functions.html#Signatures
***** "functions that don't have reasonable behavior on lists of lists" ?
***** What diff *@ **@ +@?

*** :delete adverb on arrays (rob)

** announcements 
*** next meeting: August 6th
