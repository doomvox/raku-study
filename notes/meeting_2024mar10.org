    abc 1
raku -e 'my %row = A => 1; say "abc " %row<A>';

*** TODO BUG in my setup:  my automatic save/push keeps overwriting changes pulled from github.
**** e.g. https://github.com/doomvox/raku-study/commit/193650f11613b5e2e815d02d3444e86156acee01QQQQQq0qq`

*** look at match objects with mixed named and positionals: hashify, listify, what wins?
